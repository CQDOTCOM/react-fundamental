# Browser History Mechanics
We're going to look at old, traditional browser history mechanics (like **back**
and **forward**) and see how they're built for an old internet where people
browsed between lots of different pages. We'll talk about the rise of modern
Single Page Applications that allow people to do lots of things without ever
leaving a webpage. We'll see how the rise of Single Page Applications broke
old, traditional browser history mechanics and led to the introduction of new
ways for web sites to control what **back** and **forward** really mean.

## Objectives of this section
* Understand old browser history mechanics
* Introduce URL routing
* Introduce Single Page Applications (SPAs)
* Understand why old browser history mechanics don't work for SPAs
