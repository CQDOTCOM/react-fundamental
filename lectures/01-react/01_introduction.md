## What is ReactJS?

<details>
  <summary>So, the React framework was built to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time.</summary>

  > Without React, re-rendering something meant re-rendering everything.
  This had negative implications on processing power and ultimately user experience, which at times became glitchy and laggy.

</details>
React can be used agnostically throughout your stack. This means that React can also co-exist with other Javascript frameworks, letting the other frameworks handle the models and controllers and having React sort out the views.

#### Some History

For a quick rundown, React was...
* First used by Facebook in 2011.
* Then Instagram in 2012.
* Went open source in May 2013.
