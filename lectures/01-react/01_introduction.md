## What is ReactJS?

For an intro to React, watch this video:

The React framework was built to solve one problem: building large applications with data that changes over time.

<blockquote> Before React, re-rendering one thing meant re-rendering everything.
This had negative implications on processing power and ultimately user experience, which at times became glitchy and laggy.</blockquote>

React is "agnostic" to other tools in your front end. This means that React can co-exist with other Javascript frameworks, letting the other frameworks handle the models and controllers and having React sort out the views.


#### Some History

For a quick rundown, React was...
* First used by Facebook in 2011.
* Adopted by Instagram in 2012.
* Made open source in May 2013.

To get more hands on and in-depth down the React rabbit hole, let's keep going!
