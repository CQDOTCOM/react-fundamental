## Section recap survey

Because this is a pilot, we are working out how long sections take to translate this to in class timings. Every few sections, there will be a survey on how long you've spent on the previous sections and whether the sections were useful. They aren't evenly spread so we can gauge how long certain sections take, so don't be surprised if you find one quickly after another.

**Please fill them out!** It really helps us plan to make these the best classes we can. Thanks!

This survey is on everything in the class up until this point.
