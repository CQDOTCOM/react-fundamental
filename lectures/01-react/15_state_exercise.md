# You Do: Implement State (20 minutes) #

Let's implement state in our Blog by making `body` a mutable value.
> Remember to switch the running application!

1. Initialize a state using a `constructor()` method for our `Post` to set a initial state. It should create a state attribute called `body`. Set the value associated with the `body` key in the state to be the `body` prop that's passed into the component.
2. Modify `Post`'s `render` method so that it uses the `body` from `state`, not `props`.
3. Create a `changeBody` method inside `Post` that updates `body` based on a user's input.
  - You should use `setState` somewhere in this method.
  - How can you get user input? Keep it simple and start with `prompt`.
4. Add a button to `Post`'s `render` method that triggers `changeBody`.

### Bonus I ###

Use a form to take in user input.

- The post body should be updated using a method that is triggered by `onSubmit`.
- One option is to keep track of what the new input is going to be by triggering a method using `onChange` on the `<input>`.
- Another option is to pass an event object to the `onSubmit` method and traverse the DOM from the event's target (for example, `e.target`) to find the `<input>` value.
