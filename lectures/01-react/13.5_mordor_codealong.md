Let's build something small to reinforce what you've learned so far.

## Codealong: Mordor

We're going to spin up yet another React app. Use `create-react-app` to create a `mordor` application.

> Refer to the Initial Setup for a reminder of how to do this; make sure you stop the currently running application first!

Open up your `./src` directory in your favorite text editor.

Inside of `./src` folder, create a new React Component file called `Mordor.js`.


```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Mordor extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      // soon
    );
  }
}

export default Mordor;
```

Where it says "soon", you're going to create a `<section>` to represent Mordor. Inside of Mordor is an `<article>` that represents Mount Doom, where Frodo is to throw the One Ring of Power into lava for destruction (ONCE AND FOR ALL).

The JSX inside your Mordor component's `render` function will therefore look something like this:


```jsx
<section id="mordor">
  <article id="mt-doom">
    Ring destroyed: {this.props.doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing}!
  </article>
</section>
```

Notice that this JSX is using _properties_, or `props`. When a React Component's `render` method is called, it takes any properties that were supplied to the component when it is instantiated. Later, we're going to use the `Mordor` class from inside `App.js`. When we call the component, it looks like this:

```jsx
<Morder />

```

However, we also want to pass a prop into the component, right? The Mordor component needs to know whether or not Frodo has the ring. So our call to instantiate the component is instead going to look like:

```jsx
<Mordor doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing="yeah, he still does" />
```

Notice the value that we have assigned to this React Component's `prop` of `doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing`. We can supply a custom argument here that the React element will receive for use as props. Eventually, Frodo throws the Ring of Power into the volcano. Then the next time we call the Mordor component, we could instead send a props like so:

```jsx
<Mordor doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing="NO! SAURON IS DEFEATED!" />
```

We can make the value of the prop anything we'd like, just as long as the key matches. In the Mordor component, it's looking for ` Ring destroyed: {this.props.doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing}!`, so we need to be sure to call the component and pass in a prop with a key of `doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing`.

Let's take a look at this in action. Save your changes to your Mordor component. It should look something like this (feel free to be creative).

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Mordor extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <section id="mordor">
		  <article id="mt-doom">
		    Ring destroyed: {this.props.doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing}!
		  </article>
		</section>
    );
  }
}

export default Mordor;
```

Once you're done, open the `./src/App.js`. We're going to render Mordor! We can do so by replacing the interior of `<p className="App-intro" />` with the first version of Mordor. Open your Web browser and you'll notice your component has loaded.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import Mordor from './Mordor.js';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
        </div>
        <p className="App-intro">
          <Mordor doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing="yeah, he still does" />
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Now, let's wrap things up by modifying the properties of your Mordor component... because it is time to defeat Sauron!

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import Mordor from './Mordor.js';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <div className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
        </div>
        <p className="App-intro">
          <Mordor doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing="NO! SAURON IS DEFEATED!" />
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
