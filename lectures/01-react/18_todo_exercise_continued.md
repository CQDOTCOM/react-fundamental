### Making the todo list dynamic

Now we have a todo list! But.. it isn't changeable, and we can't just _think about_ eating ice cream and going to the gym forever. At some point, we have to actually eat the ice cream (deleting it from the list) and find a gym buddy (adding that to the list). In other words, we need to be able to change the list!

Remember, in a React component, `state` is just another object, like `props`. The only difference is that `state` can be changed (remember, though, to always change it through the method `setState`). The exception is setting the initial state, which is only done once when initializing a React component with its constructor. In order to pass items to the `ToDoList` component and make them mutable, we'll need to set the state of our `MyList`. Let's continue refactoring our `MyList` component to change the `todoItems` array through state.

## Clearing the items

* At the top of the `MyList` component, create a constructor that sets an initial state for an attribute called `toDoItemArray`. It should be equal to the initial list that's passed in.
* Don't forget to change the `map` call!
* Always check to be sure your website is accurate (it should still look the same).

Now, we'll look into making this list changeable. Remember, updating state will involve calling `setState`. Let's use a simple example with a "clear" button in `MyList`.


First, in `MyList`, we define the function that will be called by the button:
```js
clearList (e) {
  this.setState({
    toDoItemArray: []
  })
}
```

Now, we need to display a button to the user. Under the list tags in `MyList`'s `render` method, we'll add JSX for a button definition.

```js
<button onClick={(e) => this.clearList(e)}>Finished the list!</button>
```

This makes our `MyList` component look like this:
```js
class MyList extends Component {

  constructor (props) {
    super()
    this.state = {
      toDoItemArray: props.theList
    }
  }

  clearList (e) {
    this.setState({
      toDoItemArray: []
    })
  }

  render() {

    let todoItems = this.state.toDoItemArray.map( (item, index) => (
      <ListItem doThis={item} key={index} />
    ))

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Things I should stop procrastinating:</h1>
        <ul>
          {todoItems}
        </ul>
        <button onClick={(e) => this.clearList(e)}>Finished the list!</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default MyList;
```

Now when we click on the button, the following will occur:
* `this.setState` will set the state, `toDoItemArray`, to be empty: `{toDoItemArray: []}`
* The render function for `MyApp` will be called and re-render the component.
* We'll feel good about ourselves for going to the gym, even if we ate ice cream first.

## Adding items

Let's add one more thing to our app: an input field for more items. In order to do so, we'll need a variable to represent the new item we'll be entering.

* Create a variable `newItem` in the state, to hold the new item that the user inputs.

> Make a new state attribute, initializing `newItem` to a blank string. (Hint: remember, `state` is just a JavaScript object, so you you need a comma between key-value pairs.)

We'll also need two additional functions to represent the following changes in state:

* `newItemChange`, for when we type characters into an input field and change the value of `newItem`  
 * We'll need to get the current value of the input field and set state accordingly.
 > Create this function (with a prop of 'e' like in `clearList`). Inside it, change the state of `newItem` to `e.target.value` - this will be the value the user entered into the form.

* `addItem`, for when we submit the form
 * We'll need to make a copy of `toDoItemArray`, push the `newItem`, set `state` and finally clear `newItem`.
 > Create this function (with a prop of 'e'). Inside it, create a new variable initialized to the value of the array that is saved in state. Then, use `yourArray.push(<value>);` to push the new item from the state into the array. Set the `newItem` state back to an empty string, and set the `toDoItemArray` state to your new array.


Lastly, we'll need to add a form to our `render` method.

```js
<form onSubmit={this.addItem}>
  <input type="text"
   placeholder="Type an item here"
   onChange={(e) => this.newItemChange(e)}
   value={this.state.newItem}
  />
  <button onClick={(e) => this.addItem(e)}>Add it!</button>
</form>
```

Notes:
 * We can use `onChange` on the `input` field to trigger an event when the text in the box is changed.  
 * Any function called when an event occurs (like functions that happen `onClick`, `onSubmit`, or `onChange`) can accept an argument that is the event. We pass this in as `e` to `newItemChange` and `addItem`.
