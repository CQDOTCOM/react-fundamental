## Components

The basic unit you'll be working with in ReactJS is a **component**. Components are pieces of our application that we can define once and reuse all over the place.

For an intro to components, watch this video:

If you're used to writing out all of one page's view in one HTML file, using components is a very different way of approaching web development.

<blockquote>
With components, there is more integration and less separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Instead of creating a few large files, the pattern is to organize a web app into small, reusable components that encompass their own content, presentation and behavior.
</blockquote>

In fact, with React, the main front end task is building components. Since they're so encapsulated, components make code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns easy.


### Identifying Components

Take a look at CraigsList. Identify the visual "components" the website is comprised of. We suggest drawing this out on paper! So something like this...

As you're drawing this out, think about the following questions...

* Where do you see "nested components;" that is, where are there components inside another component? Where do you see just one "layer" instead?
* Are there any components that share the same structure?
* For components that share the same structure, what is different about them?


### So -
What does a component look like? Let's start with a simple "Hello World" example...
