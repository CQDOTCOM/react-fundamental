# Self exercise #2!

Practice makes perfect - let's keep practicing.

This is an open ended exercise. There is no set solution that we can give you, though of course we are here to help.

## Choose one of the following:
* Option 1: Learn about React styling. Strengthen your knowledge of React by creating a React application and recreating UI.
* Option 2: Learn about and implement React animations, and apply them to the blog or the project you built in the last exercise.
* Option 3: Option 3: In addition to animations, incorporate Flow, a static type checker, into your application.
