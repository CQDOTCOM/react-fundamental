# Self exercise #2!

Practice makes perfect - let's keep practicing.

Just like before, this is an open ended exercise. There is no set solution that we can give you, though of course we are here to help.

## Choose one of the following:
* Option 1: Learn about React styling. Strengthen your knowledge of React by creating a new React application and recreating the UI, or by applying styling to the project you've started in the last exercise.
* Option 2: Learn about and implement React animations, and apply them to the blog or the project you built in the last exercise.
* Option 3: In addition to animations, incorporate Flow, a static type checker, into your application.

## Solution:
As before, there's no solution code! This is your project.

> As before, when you've been working for at least three hours and are satisfied with the state of your project, submit it as a .zip file [here](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzGU5Ae4zZ_T8gQb-uV02HJRz0F2UqyCcDkHgq2d0piGauZwc0/exec).

* Remember, it's anonymous - so we can see how well we're teaching the material. However, if you'd like, you can enter your email address, and our React gurus will get back to you in a few days with feedback.
