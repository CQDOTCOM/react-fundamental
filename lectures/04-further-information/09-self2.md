# Self exercise #2!

Practice makes perfect - let's keep practicing.

This is an open ended exercise. There is no set solution that we can give you, though of course we are here to help.

## Choose one of the following:
* Option 1: Learn about React styling. Strengthen your knowledge of React by creating a React application and recreating UI.
* Option 2: Learn about and implement React animations, and apply them to the blog or the project you built in the last exercise.
* Option 3: Option 3: In addition to animations, incorporate Flow, a static type checker, into your application.


## Solution:
As before, there's no solution code! This is your project. When you've been working for three hours *or* when you have a solidly functioning web application that you're proud of, submit it here.
* It'll get checked by our subject matter experts - no grade for you; just to see how well we're teaching the material.
* It's anonymous (as said, no grade for you!) However, if you'd like, you can enter your email address and our subject matter experts will get back to you in a few days with feedback.
