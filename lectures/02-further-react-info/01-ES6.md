# ES6

All right - we've had some fun and created a few React applications (great job!); now let's buckle in for some solid terminology. We'll try to make it fun and easy.

## What is ES6?

ES6, also called ES2015, refers to a set of language features that were added to the ECMAScript standard in 2015.

**Cool, what's ECMASript?** It's a standard that JavaScript tracks. For our purposes, it _is_ JavaScript.

**2015?** Yes, that was a while ago now, but browsers are still in the process of adopting the new features. There were more additions to JavaScript in 2016, also known as ES7. These changes weren't as drastic, or perhaps exciting, as those of ES6, which is why you don't hear much about ES7. More changes are set to be adopted this year, which will be ES8/ES2017. The entire set of modern features from ES6 and on is sometimes referred to as "ESNext".

## Why do I care?

The language features of ESNext are _awesome_. They enable you to write more concise, easier-to-read and easier-to-maintain code.

**That sounds great, but can we just do React for now?** If you look at the [React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html#enabling-es6-and-jsx), you'll see they are written with the assumption that the reader is familiar with ES6. Modern JavaScript language features (ES6, ES7 and beyond) are widely used in the React development community. Whether you're reading blog posts, studying source code or browsing questions on Stack Overflow, you're going to see them in use frequently. So, it's very helpful to have an understanding of them. And it makes your code *more fun to write!* (For example, there's some syntax that looks like a rocket ship, and using that rocket ship, you have much less you actually have to write out).

**If some browsers don't support ES6, why does anyone use it?** Great question with a simple answer: [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). Babel takes your ES6 (and beyond) code and transpiles it into browser-friendly ES5. If you use Create React App to start a project, Babel is built in, so your production build is ready for deployment. And browser support for new language features _is_ coming to browsers. All of the JavaScript features we'll talk about in this lesson except module imports can be used _right now_ in Chrome - try them out in the dev-tools console!

**Is JSX ES6?** No. JSX is the XML/HTML-like syntax you can use _in your JavaScript_ when creating React components (and there are other frameworks that use JSX as well). Babel _can_ transpile JSX to plain JavaScript, though - just like it transpiles ES6 JavaScript to ES5.

## ESNext features we'll cover here:

  - `const` and `let`
  - Arrow functions
  - Object literal shorthand
  - Template literals
  - Imports and modules

## Some of the features from ES6 and beyond we will _not_ cover:

  - [Async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)/[Await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)
  - [Generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Iterators_and_Generators)
  - [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
  - [Array spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)
  - [Array and Object destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)
  - [Object rest spread](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-object-rest-spread/)
