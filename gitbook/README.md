# Introduction to React

This repo houses all materials related to the new React module being built out.

## Setup

This book was created with [gitbook](http://toolchain.gitbook.com/). As such it's run in dev and built for production using Node.

1. Install NodeJS (using `homebrew` on Mac, `apt-get` on Linux)
2. [Install gitbook](http://toolchain.gitbook.com/setup.html)
  * `npm install gitbook-cli -g`
3. Run in development from the root of the repo with `gitbook serve`
  * This sets up live reload so no need to refresh to see changes
4. Build for production with `gitbook build`
