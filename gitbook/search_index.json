Before React, re-rendering one thing meant re-rendering everything.\nThis had negative implications on processing power and ultimately user experience, which at times became glitchy and laggy.\n\n\n\nReact is \"agnostic\" to other tools in your front end. This means that React can co-exist with other Javascript frameworks, letting the other frameworks handle the models and controllers and having React sort out the views.Some HistoryFor a quick rundown, React was...First used by Facebook in 2011.\n\nAdopted by Instagram in 2012.\n\nMade open source in May 2013.\n\nTo get more hands on and in-depth down the React rabbit hole, let's keep going!If you want to get an in-depth taste of what React is all about, here's an introduction from React.js Conf 2015. We'd recommend starting around the 8:35 mark and watching until 16:30. This link is also in the Further Reading page at the end of the React module."},"lectures/01-react/02_initial_setup.html":{"url":"lectures/01-react/02_initial_setup.html","title":"Initial Setup","keywords":"","body":"Hello World exercise - You do!Initial SetupLet's jump right in! We'll create a skeleton React project and walk through it as we go.An easy way to start React projects is to use a Terminal program called create-react-app. This is an excellent tool created by Facebook that will help you set up a barebones React app instantly, so we can just install the package and get coding!Let's use npm to install it globally so we'll always have it available in our Terminal. Run:$ npm i -g create-react-app\nOnce it's installed, move to the directory where you keep all your code.  Then, use the tool to create a new React app. You'll have to give your new app a name; we're calling the example app \"hello_world\", since that'll be our first project.$ create-react-app hello_world\nThe tool creates a new directory for our app, so let's move into it...$ cd hello_world\nUse npm start to start a server that will serve your new React application!$ npm start\nYou have now set up a Hello World app that you will continue working on during this lesson's exercises!After running $ npm start, you can view the app at http://localhost:3000One especially cool thing that we'll see is that this tool sets up our application so that the webpage automatically refreshes whenever we save any file in the directory. It's awesome.You can look in the directory and see the structure that create-react-app provides for us. It looks like this:├── README.md\n├── package.json\n├── public\n│   ├── favicon.ico\n│   └── index.html\n└── src\n    ├── App.css\n    ├── App.js\n    ├── App.test.js\n    ├── index.css\n    ├── index.js\n    └── logo.svg\nMost of the important files are in the /src directory.

Components are pieces of our application that we can define once and reuse all over the place.For an intro to components, watch this video:\n\n\n\nIf you're used to writing out all of one page's view in one HTML file, using components is a very different way of approaching web development.\nWith components, there is more integration and less separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\nInstead of creating a few large files, the pattern is to organize a web app into small, reusable components that encompass their own content, presentation and behavior.\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, with React, the main front end task is building components. Since they're so encapsulated, components make code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns easy.Identifying ComponentsTake a look at CraigsList. Identify the visual \"components\" the website is comprised of. We suggest drawing this out on paper! So something like this...As you're drawing this out, think about the following questions...Where do you see \"nested components;\" that is, where are there components inside another component? Where do you see just one \"layer\" instead?\n\nAre there any components that share the same structure?\n\nFor components that share the same structure, what is different about them?\n\nSo -What does a component look like?

In this example, we are creating a \"Hello\" component.extends ComponentComponent is the React library class we inherit from to create our component definitions. Here, we are creating a new Component subclass called Hello.  Because it \"extends\" or \"inherits from\" Component, our Hello class gets to reuse code and capabilities from React.Component.render()Every component has, at minimum, a render method. The render function is what renders the component to the screen, so it controls what is displayed for this component. From this function, we return what we want to display - in this case, a \"Hello World!\" header.Note! That header tag above looks like it's straight out of HTML, but it's actually a special language called JSX, which you'll see on the next page. For now, know that it will act like HTML when it's rendered to the screen.export default HelloThis exposes the Hello class to other files.  Those other files can import from the App.js file in order to use the Hello class.  (In our case, we'll import it into index.js.)When we try to import something from App.js, JavaScript will first attempt to match a named export.  Our only named export is Hello.  The default keyword means that anything else we try to import from this file, whose name doesn't match our named export, will automatically revert to importing Hello. Only one default export is allowed per file.Check it out!If you switch to your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000, you can see your \"Hello World!\" header.

Keeping components separate and organized is a best practice, so we created that class in its own file.To show up on the page, though, that component still needs to actually be called from somewhere.  The main \"hub\" of our React app is src/index.js.  We'll investigate how src/index.js is currently loading and rendering the component, and we'll improve the code by making it more explicit and readable.Look at your src/index.js file, and contrast it with the code below.import React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\nimport Hello from './App.js'\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\nThe first (and smallest) change is that we've dropped the CSS file import. We just aren't using it.The next change is that import App from './App'; has turned into import Hello from './App.js'.This line imports from the src/App.js file. Remember, the default part of export default Hello in src/App.js means that importing other names - like App - actually already brings in the Hello class! As a best practice, though, we're going to explicitly import the Hello class.The last change is that ReactDOM.render(\n  , has turned into ReactDOM.render(\n    ,.This changes the ReactDOM.render call to explicitly say \"Render whatever the component Hello returns.\"Virtual DOM IntroYou should be familiar with the DOM.  You may have noticed that our src/index.js code mentions ReactDOM.  ReactDOM doesn't refer to the same DOM we know. Instead, it refers to a \"Virtual DOM.\" The Virtual DOM is a key piece of how React works. So how is different?\n\n\n\nIn React, the virtual DOM is a staging area for changes that will eventually be implemented.If you're interested in learning more about the Virtual DOM, check this video out. This link is also in the Further Reading page at the end of the React module.You know every component has, at a minimum, a render method. The render method generates a Virtual DOM node to be added to the actual DOM.The contents of this node are what we define in the method's return statement, using JSX.The ReactDOM.render function takes two arguments:ReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\n uses the name of the component to render. Inside the Hello component in our App.js file, we returned the content to render:  a div with those \"Hello World!\" and tea headers (written in JSX).\ndocument.getElementById('root') finds the DOM element to append that content to. This argument can be any element on the page. Here, we're simply appending it to an element with the id root.  (Look through the index.html file if you're curious about the HTML structure from create-react-app.)\nWhen our index.js is processed, our virtual DOM is compared to the regular DOM, and only the 'root' element on the page updates.Side note: What is  written in? JSX! Whenever you use a self-closing tag in JSX, you MUST end it with a /, like  in the above example.

Let's make it more interesting.Rather than simply display \"Hello world\", let's display a greeting to the user. We'll make that greeting dynamically changeable based on the user's name.The question is, how do we add a name to our Hello component without hardcoding it into the component's render method?Watch this video and follow along using this codepen to try it yourself!\n\n\n\n\nHello World exercise - You do!Code along: Adding props to our componentLet's use \"props\" to make our Hello World app more flexible.First, a single propWe want to make a greeting that's reusable for many different users, so we'll have a name prop for the name of the user.In src/index.js, we'll change the line that renders the Hello component to include this name prop. The new line will be:We pass in data wherever we are rendering our component. In rendering the Hello component above, we pass in a prop called \"name\" with a value of \"Nick\".Your index.js should now look like this:import React from 'react'\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\nimport Hello from './App.js'\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\nIf you check your application now, nothing has changed.

A better practice is to organize values in some kind of object and then pass props to the component from that.

Instead, we'll create an object that holds Nick's name and age, making it clearer for other developers and easier to change in the future. In your index.js file, below the imports, add this object definition:var person = {\n  personName: \"Nick\",\n  personAge: 24\n}\nNext, we'll update what's passed into the component. Near the bottom of your index.js, modify the ReactDOM.render call:ReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\nWe don't have to change anything in App.js, because it's still receiving exactly the same values for exactly the same two props - name and age.

If you browse to http://localhost:3000 nothing should have changed.Try changing the values inside the person object without changing the ReactDOM.render call. See how the page updates.Multiple props from a more complex objectSince we're just pulling props out of an object, we can use any object we want. For example, we can nest an array inside it. Let's say our user has some favorite animals. Update your object to include an array:var person = {\n  personName: \"Nick\",\n  personAge: 24,\n  favorites: [\n    \"capybaras\",\n    \"Tigers\",\n    \"Dinosaurs count!\"\n  ]\n}\nNow we can use this new information as a prop, just like normal. You could choose to pass a single element (favorites[0]) or the entire array.  We'll use the entire array so that the component can display all a person's favorite animals. First, update your ReactDOM.render call in index.js:ReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\nIf you check your application now, nothing has changed. Remember, a component class will just ignore any props it receives that it doesn't use. But, we want to use the favorites!

We could fix the spacing and still include all the animals.  Instead, to review some syntax, let's just modify the code to render the first value.\n  Hello {this.props.name}!\n  You are {this.props.age} years old.\n  You love: {this.props.animals[0]}\n\nCheck it out!Read more about using props in JSX, if you'd like!

To do this, we can reference a comment using  inside of Post's render method.\nStarting from the blog post code, let's create a new file for a Comment component, src/Comment.js:import React, {Component} from 'react'\n\nclass Comment extends Component {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.props.body}\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Comment\nThis looks pretty standard - we've defined our component class, which inherits from React.Component.

Now, instead of this line, we'll want to render a Comment component (which renders a paragraph with the comments, so it will do the same thing!). Edit that line to render a comment instead of directly rendering a paragraph.  Make sure you send through the body prop that the Comment component class needs:\nLet's reflect on what just happened. We rendered a component inside another component. Technically, we just nested components. Very much like how we imported Post from App.js into index.js and rendered a post inside index.js, we've imported Comment from Comment.js into App.js and rendered a comment. Inside App.js, we're using some of the props to render a post and simply passing the comments prop on to be rendered with the Comment component class. So the flow of the props looks like this:Note: We could have put all of our code in one file, but it's a good practice to break components out into different files to help practice separation of concerns.

React may seem very confusing at first with all of the jargon, so let's break everything down:React is a framework created by developers at Facebook. It is aimed at being the 'view' of your Javascript application. It focuses on creating a component-based architecture.\n\nA component is an independent, reusable piece of your user interface.\n\nThe Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the DOM, or an abstraction of the DOM. React doesn't apply your changes to the DOM directly. While it creates and manipulates elements, it does so through custom React objects. The results of that manipulation are then rendered to the DOM. This keeps you from having to focus on changing the state of a  tag constantly.\n\nJSX is a standard that React uses to represent HTML elements as XML tags. It looks like a template language but is much more powerful. Each JSX tag represents a React Element, and a React Class is composed of multiple elements. You express your visual user interface through nested JSX tags that can render additional components.\n\nProperties are arguments passed into a component, as if they were arguments to a function. The component can then use this data to render something or pass the data on to another component.\n\nLet's put something together really quickly to reinforce what you've learned so far.CodealongWe're going to spin up yet another React app. Use create-react-app to create a mordor application.Refer to the Initial Setup for a reminder of how to do this; make sure you stop the currently running application first!Open up your ./src directory in your favorite text editor.Inside of ./src folder, create a new React Component file called Mordor.js.import React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Mordor extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      // soon\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Mordor;\nWhere it says \"soon\", you're going to create a  to represent Mordor. Inside of Mordor is an  that represents Mount Doom, where Frodo is to throw the One Ring of Power into lava for destruction (ONCE AND FOR ALL).The JSX inside your Mordor component's render function will therefore look something like this:\n  \n    Ring destroyed: {this.props.doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing}!\n  \n\nNotice that this JSX is using properties, or props. When a React Component's render method is called, it takes any properties that were supplied to the component when it is instantiated. Later, we're going to use the Mordor class from inside App.js. When we call the component, it looks like this:\n\nHowever, we also want to pass a prop into the component, right? The Mordor component needs to know whether or not Frodo has the ring. So our call to instantiate the component is instead going to look like:\nNotice the value that we have assigned to this React Component's prop of doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing. We can supply a custom argument here that the React element will receive for use as props. Eventually, Frodo throws the Ring of Power into the volcano. Then the next time we call the Mordor component, we could instead send a props like so:\nWe can make the value of the prop anything we'd like, just as long as the key matches. In the Mordor component, it's looking for Ring destroyed: {this.props.doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing}!, so we need to be sure to call the component and pass in a prop with a key of doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing.Let's take a look at this in action. Save your changes to your Mordor component.

ECMAScript5 is hot and new, and you're working hard to create user interface components using vanilla JavaScript. How would you create components like React's using vanilla JavaScript for organization? Here are a few differences to consider:The use of prototype for inheritance instead of the ES6 model of Class.\n\nDOM manipulation using createElement, getElement..., and other vanilla JavaScript DOM API methods versus our ReactDOM.render with JSX on the virtual DOM.\n\nBuilding constructor objects that contain an element (or el) that is rendered using a render method.\n\nHow would you handle updating properties going into the component? How would this affect your constructor?\n\nAs you consider this scenario, think about the ease that the Virtual DOM provides you by directly handling the creation and updating of DOM elements on the page. React creates special elements on the Virtual DOM and then elements are rendered for you with ease so you don't have to create individual React elements to build each React component."},"lectures/01-react/14_state.html":{"url":"lectures/01-react/14_state.html","title":"State","keywords":"","body":"StateAt this point, we know about React properties and how they relate to our component's data.The thing is, props represent data that will be the same every time our component is rendered. What about data in our application that may change depending on user action?\n\nThat's where state comes in.\n\nWatch this video and follow along using this codepen to try it yourself!\n\n\n\nValues stored in a component's state are mutable attributes.State is similar to props, but is meant to be changed.\n\nLike props, which we access with this.props.val, we can access state values using this.state.val\n\nSetting up and modifying state is not as straightforward as working with props. Instead, it requires multiple methods - explicitly declaring the mutation and then defining methods to define how to update our state.\n\nLet's switch gears back to our hello_world project.Be sure to switch which app is running locally!Let's modify our earlier Hello World example to include a new MoodTracker component. There will be a mood displayed, and eventually a user will click a button to indicate on a scale of 1-10 how much of that mood they are feeling.Initial StateFirst, now that we're going to have a state, we're going to have an initial value. When working with classes, a good way to make initial values is by creating a constructor: constructor (props) {}. Constructors say, \"When you create an instance of this class, do this.\" Without a constructor explicitly defined by us, our components will use the default constructor inherited from the Component class. That's why we didn't need a constructor before - we weren't doing anything differently than the normal default for every component.class Hello extends Component {\n  // what should happen when the component is first created\n  constructor (props) {\n  }\n\n  // what should the component render\n  render () {\n    //  ....\n  }\n}\nThe first thing we always put in a constructor is a call to super(), which says \"You should still do the default initialization for this class.\"class Hello extends Component {\n  // what should happen when the component is first created\n  constructor (props) {\n    // make call to parent class' (Component) constructor\n    super()\n  }\n\n  // what should the component render\n  render () {\n    //  ....\n  }\n}\nAfter this, we can define what's new. What's new for us right now is that when the class first gets called, we want to set an initial state. We can do this by giving a value to this.state, the component's special state object. Inside of that object, we can define any state variables we'd like.We'll start our state with just one key-value pair inside.  The key or label will be moodPoints, and the initial value for the moodPoints key will be 1.At the top of the Hello class in your src/App.js file, add the constructor function.class Hello extends Component {\n  // what should happen when the component is first created\n  constructor (props) {\n    // make call to parent class' (Component) constructor\n    super()\n    // define an initial state\n    this.state = {\n      moodPoints: 1 // initialize this.state.moodPoints to be 1\n    }\n  }\n\n  // what should the component render\n  render () {\n    //  ....\n  }\n}\nNow, let's make sure we display that information to the user. Still in App.js, in your render method, we'll let the user know how many mood points they are at by adding in a line:// note how similar this looks to accessing props\nYou are this happy: {this.state.moodPoints}\nAll together, the code inside render for our App.js can now look like this:return (\n  \n    Hello {this.props.name}!\n    You are {this.props.age} years old.\n    You love: {this.props.animals[0]}\n    On a scale of 1-10\n    You are this happy: {this.state.moodPoints}\n  \n)\nCheck it out! If you browse to http://localhost:3000, your state will be displayed.Changing StateOk, we set an initial state. But how do we go about changing it?We need to set up some sort of trigger event to change the mood counter.We will create a button that the user can click, which will increase their mood by one.First, we will create a method to increase the mood.  Under the Hello constructor, above the render method, add this method:increaseMood(e) {\n  this.setState({\n    moodPoints: this.state.moodPoints + 1\n  })\n}\nNote that we call this.setState to change the state.Now, we'll create the button to trigger calling this function. The button will be displayed to the user, so we'll add it to the render function. When the user clicks it, we'll call the increaseMood function.  render () {\n    // remember: can only return one top-level element\n\n    return (\n      \n        Hello {this.props.name}\n        You are {this.props.age} years old\n        On a scale of 1-10\n        You are this happy: {this.state.moodPoints}\n         this.increaseMood(e)}>Cheer up!\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\nAltogether, your App.js file now looks like this:// bring in React and Component from React\n\nimport React, {Component} from 'react'\n\n// define our Hello component\nclass Hello extends Component {\n\n  constructor (props) {\n\n    // make call to parent class' (Component) constructor\n    super()\n    // define an initial state\n    this.state = {\n      moodPoints: 1 // initialize this.state.counter to be 0\n    }\n  }\n\n  // increase moodPoints by 1 in this.state\n  increaseMood(e) {\n    this.setState({\n      moodPoints: this.state.moodPoints + 1\n    })\n  }\n\n  // what should the component render\n  render () {\n    // make sure to return some UI\n\n    return (\n      \n        Hello {this.props.name}\n        You are {this.props.age} years old\n        You love {this.props.animals[0]}\n        On a scale of 1-10\n        You are this happy: {this.state.moodPoints}\n         this.increaseMood(e)}>Cheer up!\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Hello\nCheck it out! If you browse to http://localhost:3000, your button now changes the state.Whenever we run .setState, our component calculates the difference or \"diff\" between the current DOM and the virtual DOM node. Then, it figures out how to update the state of the DOM in as few manipulations as possible; it only replaces the current DOM with parts that have changed.This is super important! Using React, we only change parts of the DOM that need to be changed.This has implications for performance.\n\nWe do not re-render the entire component like we have been so far.\n\nThis is one of React's core advantages.\n\nChallenge: Count to 10After 10 clicks, the user should see the counter reset to 1.Check solution here!If you're interested in reading more in depth about this, here is more on what should & shouldn't go in state.

We call super() to call the base class (React.Component)'s constructor. Next, the constructor's state is set. Here we define that our Component's state contains a body attribute that contains whatever the body prop is passed to the component. For example, let's consider the data flow.\nInside of our component, our constructor would essentially be saying:constructor (props) { // props = { body: \"This is my first blog post\" }\n  super()\n  this.state = {\n    body: props.body // props.body = \"This is my first blog post\"\n  }\n}\nNext, we define a listener in our JSX element of . This calls the changeBody() method .onClick. That is defined here: this.changeBody(e)}>Edit Body\nWhen the button is clicked, the changeBody() method is called.changeBody (e) {\n  let newBody = prompt(\"What should the new body be?\")\n  this.setState({\n    body: newBody\n  })\n}\nFrom here, we use prompt() to get a new value from the user (but please do not ever do this in production - users hate popups!). setState() is then called which then will eventually lead to render() being called to automatically re-rendering your new data.

Todo list.So, we've gone through all of the basics of React. To really hammer it home with practice, let's walk through complete creation of an app. This will be a to-do list, keeping track of everything we need to do for the day (after we finish this!). It's a lot, so we're going to want it to be editable.This is what our list will look like when we're finished:Let's get started!Because this is a new exercise, be sure to close the running application in Terminal first.\n\nChange directories to the main directory you're storing your projects in. Inside it, run your command:$ create-react-app todo-list\nThe tool created a new directory for our app, so let's move into it...$ cd todo-list\nUse npm start to start a server that will serve your new React application!$ npm start\nCheck it out! If you browse to http://localhost:3000, you should have a fresh react app.\nMake sure that as you go, you frequently check the site to ensure your changes are all reflecting accurately!\nFirst, the basic list.Let's change the name of the component in App.js to something more meaningful, like MyList. Then, we'll change the contents of the HTML to have a header and the start of a list.This looks like:import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass MyList extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n           Things I should stop procrastinating:\n        \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyList;\nRemember to change the name of the component where it's rendered in index.js!Now, our webpage displays an empty list.We've learned that we should make new files for each component and that different functionalities should be split into different components.Let's make a component for ListItems. This component can simply render  Make the list! so that we are starting with something in this list.Remember to use an export statement at the end of the new file to make the code in this file available elsewhere in our application.\nDon't forget to import your ListItem component into App.js.  Then, include the component in what MyList renders with  under the existing header (in place of the existing list item)!\nAt this point, our app looks like this:Side note - let's quickly format it a little more nicely!Since we'll be looking at this for a while, let's make it less of an eyesore. Feel free to change the index.css file to include anything you'd like; on mine, I've centered the text and given it a light green background. You can grab  mine here.Second, props.This is a great start - we've already nested components (ListItem inside of MyList). Now, let's add some props to make this useful and check that current list item off!Let's first just pass a prop into ListItem from MyList. We'll call the prop something simple, like doThis. I'm pretty hungry; I'll pass in a value of \"buy ice cream.\"Then, in ListItem, we'll add a list item that uses the doThis prop instead of the existing hard-coded text.Now, we have in App.js:import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport ListItem from './ListItem';\n\nclass MyList extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Things I should stop procrastinating:\n        \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyList;\n... and in ListItem.js:import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass ListItem extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.props.doThis}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ListItem;\nOur app now looks like this:\nThird, render different items in an array.If we want to make this a truly extensible list, we could create an array of items, pass them into props through the ListItem component, and then render each item. Let's do that now.Borrowing from a bonus exercise earlier, the easiest way to do this is by using the map function. A map is like a for loop. With map, you make a new variable and iterate through each item in an array with it. It looks like this:let  = .map( (local_Variable_Name_to_Loop, index) => (\n  \n))\nHere's a simple example that makes a new array by adding an ! to each element of an array.const phrases = ['ice cream', 'dinosaurs', 'hobbits']\nlet excitedPhrases = phrases.map( (phrase, index) => {\n  return newPhrase = phrase + '!'\n})\n// excitedPhrases is [\"ice cream!\", \"dinosaurs!\", \"hobbits!\"]\nPlanIn the MyList component, have an array of items for the list, uncreatively called theList.\n\nCreate a variable to refer to the new array output by the map method, uncreatively but helpfully called todoItems.\n\nUse map to iterate through the todoItems array, one item (this could be any name you'd like) at a time, and use each one to create a ListItem component in the todoItems list.\n\nWe can later refer to this list by just calling the variable in JSX (like any other variable).  For example, we could say  {todoItems}.\n\nImplementing the PlanHere is the map function call that will do this for us, which we'll put in the MyList component.:let todoItems = this.props.theList.map( (item, index) => (\n  \n))\nLet's also actually create that array! In index.js, create an array variable called toDos. Fill it with what you need to do for the day.My final MyList component class looks like this:\nclass MyList extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n    let todoItems = this.props.theList.map( (item, index) => (\n      \n    ))\n\n    return (\n      \n        Things I should stop procrastinating:\n        \n          {todoItems}\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nAnd the index.js file:import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport MyList from './App';\nimport './index.css';\n\nvar toDos = [\"Buy ice cream\", \"Eat ice cream\", \"Go to the gym\"]\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\nAnd the ListItem.js, which hasn't changed:import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass ListItem extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.props.doThis}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ListItem;\n\nNow what we have is:\n"},"lectures/01-react/18_todo_exercise_continued.html":{"url":"lectures/01-react/18_todo_exercise_continued.html","title":"Exercise - Todo list - part 2","keywords":"","body":"Making the todo list dynamicNow we have a todo list! But.. it isn't changeable, and we can't just think about eating ice cream and going to the gym forever. At some point, we have to actually eat the ice cream (deleting it from the list) and find a gym buddy (adding that to the list). In other words, we need to be able to change the list!Remember, in a React component, state is just another object, like props. The only difference is that state can be changed (remember, though, to always change it through the method setState). The exception is setting the initial state, which is only done once when initializing a React component with its constructor. In order to pass items to the ToDoList component and make them mutable, we'll need to set the state of our MyList. Let's continue refactoring our MyList component to change the todoItems array through state.Clearing the itemsAt the top of the MyList component, create a constructor that sets an initial state for an attribute called toDoItemArray. It should be equal to the initial list that's passed in.\n\nDon't forget to change the map call!\n\nAlways check to be sure your website is accurate (it should still look the same).\n\nNow, we'll look into making this list changeable. Remember, updating state will involve calling setState. Let's use a simple example with a \"clear\" button in MyList.First, in MyList, we define the function that will be called by the button:clearList (e) {\n  this.setState({\n    toDoItemArray: []\n  })\n}\nNow, we need to display a button to the user. Under the list tags in MyList's render method, we'll add JSX for a button definition. this.clearList(e)}>Finished the list!\nThis makes our MyList component look like this:class MyList extends Component {\n\n  constructor (props) {\n    super()\n    this.state = {\n      toDoItemArray: props.theList\n    }\n  }\n\n  clearList (e) {\n    this.setState({\n      toDoItemArray: []\n    })\n  }\n\n  render() {\n\n    let todoItems = this.state.toDoItemArray.map( (item, index) => (\n      \n    ))\n\n    return (\n      \n        Things I should stop procrastinating:\n        \n          {todoItems}\n        \n         this.clearList(e)}>Finished the list!\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyList;\nDon't forget to try it out!Now when we click on the button, the following will occur:this.setState will set the state, toDoItemArray, to be empty: {toDoItemArray: []}\n\nThe render function for MyApp will be called and re-render the component.\n\nWe'll feel good about ourselves for going to the gym, even if we ate ice cream first.\n\nAdding itemsLet's add one more thing to our app: an input field for more items. In order to do so, we'll need a variable to represent the new item we'll be entering.Create a variable newItem in the state, to hold the new item that the user inputs.\n\nMake a new state attribute, initializing newItem to a blank string. (Hint: remember, state is just a JavaScript object, so you you need a comma between key-value pairs.)We'll also need two additional functions to represent the following changes in state:newItemChange, for when we type characters into an input field and change the value of newItemWe'll need to get the current value of the input field and set state accordingly.\nCreate this function (with an event parameter of 'e' like in clearList). Inside it, change the state of newItem to e.target.value - this will be the value the user entered into the form.\n\naddItem, for when we submit the formWe'll need to make a copy of toDoItemArray, push the newItem, set state and finally clear newItem.\nCreate this function (with an event parameter of 'e'). Inside it, create a new variable initialized to the value of the array that is saved in state. Then, use yourArray.push(); to push the new item from the state into the array. Set the newItem state back to an empty string, and set the toDoItemArray state to your new array.\n\nLastly, we'll need to add a form to our render method.\n   this.newItemChange(e)}\n   value={this.state.newItem}\n  />\n   this.addItem(e)}>Add it!\n\nNotes:We can use onChange on the input field to trigger an event when the text in the box is changed.  \n\nAny function called when an event occurs (like functions that happen onClick, onSubmit, or onChange) can accept an argument that is the event. We pass this in as e to newItemChange and addItem.Check it out!

We'll try to make it fun and easy.What is ES6?ES6, also called ES2015, refers to a set of language features that were added to the ECMAScript standard in 2015.Cool, what's ECMASript? It's a standard that JavaScript tracks. For our purposes, it is JavaScript.2015? Yes, that was a while ago now, but browsers are still in the process of adopting the new features. There were more additions to JavaScript in 2016, also known as ES7. These changes weren't as drastic, or perhaps exciting, as those of ES6, which is why you don't hear much about ES7. More changes are set to be adopted this year, which will be ES8/ES2017. The entire set of modern features from ES6 and on is sometimes referred to as \"ESNext\".Why do I care?The language features of ESNext are awesome. They enable you to write more concise, easier-to-read and easier-to-maintain code.That sounds great, but can we just do React for now? If you look at the React docs, you'll see they are written with the assumption that the reader is familiar with ES6. Modern JavaScript language features (ES6, ES7 and beyond) are widely used in the React development community. Whether you're reading blog posts, studying source code or browsing questions on Stack Overflow, you're going to see them in use frequently. So, it's very helpful to have an understanding of them. And it makes your code more fun to write! (For example, there's some syntax that looks like a rocket ship, and using that rocket ship, you have much less you actually have to write out).If some browsers don't support ES6, why does anyone use it? Great question with a simple answer: Babel. Babel takes your ES6 (and beyond) code and transpiles it into browser-friendly ES5. If you use Create React App to start a project, Babel is built in, so your production build is ready for deployment. And browser support for new language features is coming to browsers. All of the JavaScript features we'll talk about in this lesson except module imports can be used right now in Chrome - try them out in the dev-tools console!Is JSX ES6? No. JSX is the XML/HTML-like syntax you can use in your JavaScript when creating React components (and there are other frameworks that use JSX as well). Babel can transpile JSX to plain JavaScript, though - just like it transpiles ES6 JavaScript to ES5.ESNext features we'll cover here:const and let\n\nArrow functions\n\nObject literal shorthand\n\nTemplate literals\n\nImports and modules\n\nSome of the features from ES6 and beyond we will not cover:Promises\n\nAsync/Await\n\nGenerators\n\nClasses\n\nArray spread\n\nArray and Object destructuring assignment\n\nObject rest spread\n\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/02-ES6-ConstLet.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/02-ES6-ConstLet.html","title":"Const and Let","keywords":"","body":"const and letconst and let are new keywords for declaring variables. Where before you would have declaredvar x = 1;\nYou can now declareconst x = 1;\norlet x = 1;\nConstconst is short for \"constant\". It very easily means, \"declaring a variable that will be constant.\" So, a const can't be reassigned. if I assign a const to a primitive type (a string, number, or boolean, for example), I can't change its value at all.const hi = 'hello';\nhi = 'goodbye';\nThe code above will throw an error, because I attempted to change the reference to a const.This CodePen illustrates this. Click the little red exclamation point to see the error.If possible, try to use const whenever you can to maintain predictability.But!Just to make it a little trickier, this does not, however, mean that a const is immutable. JavaScript assigns by reference. This means that a variable can't be reassigned entirely, but we can change a property of an object or add an item to an array. If I assign an object literal as a const variable like this:const anObject = {\n  hi: 'hello',\n  animal: `muffin`\n};\nI can then change a key in it, mutating its value:anObject.animal = 'puppy';\nThe new value of anObject is now:{\n  hi: 'hello',\n  animal: 'puppy'\n}\nThis is valid, because anObject's reference doesn't change. I just can't wipe the whole variable.LetSo, that's const. The other replacement for var is let.let has the same normal assignment rules as var. The value and reference of a let variable can change, so this will run with no errors:let hi = 'hello';\nhi = 'goodbye';\nOpen the console (at the bottom of the window) in This CodePen and you'll see that the JavaScript runs, and \"goodbye\" is logged to the console (to view the console, click the 'console' tab at the bottom).When declaring variables using ES6 syntax, if you need to declare a variable whose value will not change, declare it as a const. If the variable's value will or might change, declare it as a let.let, like var, can be reassigned as much as you like. Why use let at all, then, when you could just use var?Let is actually about scopingVariables in JavaScript are 'scoped' - or the same within - either globally or within an entire function. Since var in javascript is scoped to the nearest parent function, it can be pretty unpredictable, right?function varTest() {\n  var x = 1;\n  if (true) {\n    var x = 2;  // same variable!\n    console.log(x);  // Prints 2\n  }\n  console.log(x);  // This is going to print 2!\n}\nDespite declaring var x in two different places, it's the same variable, leading to some unwanted and unexpected behavior. Scoping is something that always needs to be tracked in JavaScript for precisely reasons like this.ES6 introduced let to fix this scoping issue. Using let is more predictable and straightforward. let is a block scoped variable, so its value is scoped to the nearest curly braces {} rather than the whole function. Thus, within a loop, let will create a new instance for each iteration - instead of changing the original variable.function letTest() {\n  let x = 1;\n  if (true) {\n    let x = 2;  // curly braces = different variable\n    console.log(x);  // 2\n  }\n  console.log(x);  // 1\n}\nYou can see this in action in This CodePen - open the console to see the difference.Here's another example. Using regular var, this always prints 5.var array = [];\nfor(var i=0; i\nHowever, if we use let, we can give each variable in that for loop its own scope.var array = [];\nfor(let i=0;i\nWith more predictable scope, let variables are easier to keep track of visually than vars, and less likely to introduce bugs to your code.Thought Exercise:Here's a tricky one. Look at your blog project - the index.js file. You have:var post = {\n  title: \"Dinosaurs are awesome\",\n  authors: [\n    \"Stealthy Stegosaurus\",\n    \"Tiny trex\",\n    \"Iguanadon Ivory\"\n  ],\n  body: \"Check out this body property!\",\n  comments: [\n    \"First!\",\n    \"Great post!\",\n    \"Hire him!\"\n]\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\nShould that post variable be a let or a const?\n Did you think about it? Do you have an idea? Then the answer is...\n  `const`. We want to show one post which will be displayed\n  constantly. The one post should never change.\n\n  Now, the comments might change. People should be able to add or remove their\n  own comments. Remember that `const` only refers to what the variable `post`\n  references. We're still allowed to modify the values inside of the object.\n\n  Using `const` will guarantee that the `post` object is never swapped out\n  for an entirely other blog post object. Using `const` will still allow us\n  to modify the values of the `title`, `authors`, `body` and `comments` inside\n  the constant object.\n\n\n\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/03-ES6-Arrow.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/03-ES6-Arrow.html","title":"Arrow","keywords":"","body":"Arrow functions\"function\", \"function\", \"function\", are you tired of writing that word? So are we. The arrow function => is a more concise syntax for declaring functions. It looks like a little rocket arrow, in fact, and something that cool isn't usually in javascript. Arrow functions are not only different in syntax, however - their scope is also different from a regular function declaration.Basic SyntaxUsing the function keyword, to create a function that adds two to an argument, you'd write:function addTwo(num) {\n  return num + 2;\n}\nHere, we are naming our function addTwo and it takes in one parameter, num.Using arrow syntax, you'd write:var addTwo = num => {\n  return num + 2;\n}\nHere, we declare our function as a variable: var AddTwo. To pass in the variable, we put it after an equal sign: var addTwo = num. Then we have the arrow function and the actual function definition.If there are multiple parameters passed into an arrow function, you put them in parentheses, just like a traditional function. Before, using the function keyword, you would write:function multiply(x, y) {\n  return x * y;\n}\nWith the arrow syntax, it's:var multiply = (x, y) => {\n  return x * y;\n}\nDo you remember const?Anything that was a var in ES6 is better practice to write as a let or a const.\nYou can write functions using const or let as well. This can be helpful to know that the function's assignment later cannot change (in the case of const) or explicitly declared as can (in the case of let). Using let or const with a function is not necessary, but in some cases it's good practice (more on that later).So now with the arrow syntax, we had:var addTwo = num => {\n  return num + 2;\n}\nAnd we can simply change the var to a const.const addTwo = num => {\n  return num + 2;\n}\nAnother thing to note is that if the function does nothing except a return, we can simplify it even further:const addTwo = num => num + 2;\nnote that we dropped the brackets and return keywordCompare this ES6 declaration with our original function!// traditional\nfunction addTwo(num) {\n  return num + 2;\n}\n\n// now\nconst addTwo = num => num + 2;\nYou can play with arrow functions in this CodePen. Remember, you can also use ES6 syntax in the Chrome dev-tools console, and your Create React App projects are transpiled with Babel, so you can use ES6 there too."},"lectures/02-further-react-info/04-ES6-Arrow2.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/04-ES6-Arrow2.html","title":"Arrows, Continued","keywords":"","body":"Implicit returnContinuing a thought, the last thing we noted is that if the function does nothing except a return, we can simplify it even further:const addTwo = num => num + 2;\nWe dropped the brackets and return keyword.If there is no block following the arguments of an arrow function (meaning nothing in { } brackets), whatever follows is the return value of the function. The addTwo example above simply returns the value of num + 2. This is called an implicit return.So we can write the arrow function for anything -const addTwo = num => {\n  return num + 2;\n}\nas well asconst mutateNumbers = num => {\n  newNum = 6;\n  alert(newNum);\n  return num + newNum;\n}\nBut we can only use implicit return for the first function, addTwo. Because mutateNumbers has more than just a return statement in it, we still need the brackets.So addTwo can be simplified to one line, but mutateNumbers cannot be.const addTwo = num => num + 2;\nUsing implicit returns can shorten our syntax and make it more readable. The following function lowercaseListOfWords takes one argument, an array of strings, and returns a new array of lowercase strings.Written with functions, this would look something like:function lowercaseListOfWords(arrayToModify) {\n  return arrayToModify.map(function(word) {\n    return word.toLocaleLowerCase();\n  });\n}\nHowever, using ES6, the arrow function, and implicit returns, we can make that one (albeit long!) line:const lowercaseListOfWords = arrayToModify => arrayToModify.map(word => word.toLocaleLowerCase());\nImportantly, one gotcha to be aware of with implicit returns is that object literals must be wrapped in parentheses, so the interpreter (browser, compiler, etc.) can distinguish them from blocks. An example:const isItActive = isActive => ({ active: isActive });\nEven though this function only returns one thing, because this function implicitly returns an object literal, it must be wrapped in parentheses.Play around with implicit returns from arrow functions in this CodePen.This binding - and the lack thereofSo - now that we've learned all the fun syntactic sugar of the arrow function, let's talk about the benefit of using it in execution context.In non-arrow functions, every function defines its own this. There are tons of hacks to preserve the context, like var that = this and using .bind(this). This might look familiar:function eatBreakfast(pancakes) {\n  var that = this;\n  that.food = 'Knife please?';\n  Waiter\n  .bringCutlery(function (silverware) {\n    that.food = silverware;\n  });\n}\nAnother popular variant is var self = this. However you like to do it, you don't need to do it anymore!Arrow functions don't change the definition of this. So, if this is already defined in the scope, and you call an arrow function, you can access this directly.The equivalent arrow function:const eatBreakfast = pancakes => {\n  this.food = 'Knife please?';\n  Waiter\n  .bringCutlery((silverware) => this.food = silverware);\n}\nCheck it out - the arrow function can be anywhere you declare a function!"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/05-ES6-Literals.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/05-ES6-Literals.html","title":"Literals","keywords":"","body":"This is the last bit of ES6 we'll check out before doing an exercise!Object literal shorthandObject literal shorthand is a simple but useful bit of syntactic sugar. If you want to assign a variable as the value of the key of the same name, you don't have to write it twice. What?Okay, what if we declare a variable, price, and set it equal to 100 (it's certainly something nice!): const price = 100;We then have an object called item. Now, item also has a variable of how much that item costs, which happens to also be price. They are different variables (one is global, and the other is specific to the item object); they just happen to share the same name. So our item object might be:const item = {\n  price: 15,\n};\nNow, let's say that when we initialize item, instead of hard coding a number into the initialization, we want to set price to be whatever the global price is. This global price is also stored in a variable called price, right?It looks like this:const price = 100;\n\nconst item = {\n  price: price,\n};\nIt's weird looking, but it works.Well, it turns out that having two different variables with the same name and setting them equal to each other is a pretty common thing to do. ES6 decided to just simplify this by dropping the duplicate and having it mean the same thing. So now we can do:const price = 100;\n\nconst item = {\n  price,\n};\nLess to write, and less to read when you come back to it. A win-win!Template literalsTemplate literals bring us string interpolation in JavaScript. This means we can create dynamic strings with more readable syntax.Before ES6, we had:const name = 'Mike';\nconst greeting = 'Hi, ' + name + '.';\nNow, using template literals, we can make this easier:const name = 'Mike';\nconst greeting = `Hi, ${name}.`;\nNote that now, we can directly refer to the variable using ${} syntax within our string.In fact, combining an arrow function with a template literal, we can do this:const greeting = name => `Hi, ${name}.`;\nCheck it out in CodePen!Lastly! Imports and modulesIn ES6, you can import modules directly without declaring them as global variables. This makes namespacing your app a non-issue. Before module imports, namespace was often a primary concern in JavaScript.So, if you want export my addTwo function as a module, you can create a file called \"addTwo.js\":const addTwo = num => num + 2;\n\nexport default addTwo;\nAnd in another file, say \"app.js\", i can import it:import addTwo from './addTwo'; //\n\naddTwo(3);\nYou can also export multiple modules from a file, like so:export const addTwo = num => num + 2;\n\nexport const addThree = num => num + 3;\nAnd somewhere else:import { addTwo, addThree } from './arithmetic';\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/06-ES6-Exercise.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/06-ES6-Exercise.html","title":"ES6 Exercise","keywords":"","body":"Exercise!We've just learned a bunch of ES6.We've learned:\n`const` and `let` instead of `var`\nRemember, When declaring variables using ES6 syntax, if you need to declare a variable whose value will _not_ change, declare it as a `const`.

React class components give you poperties that you don't always need, namely state, methods like setState, lifecycle methods like componentDidMount and componentWillReceiveProps, refs and more.Some components are purely presentational. They take props and render UI. As a React class, these components usually just contain a render method. Rather than create them as classes, you can write them as functions. A React Functional Component takes the props object as its argument, and returns JSX. Here's a very simple example. As a class, we might have:class Name extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Name: {this.props.firstName} {this.props.lastName}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nBut with ES6, we now have:const Name = props => (\n  \n    Name: {props.firstName} {props.lastName}\n  \n);\nThe whole declaration of class, extends, React.component, etc - it's all been replaced. We now just have the component name, an input for the props, and what is returned. Simplicity at its finest!Functional components don't have to be \"simple\" - they can contain all kinds of logic. They're just JavaScript functions - so they can be as simple or complex as we make them. Let's make a more complicated example. What if we wanted a table of fruits?FruitTable will render a table that looks something like this:This component written as a class, as we're used to, would look like this:class FruitTable extends React.Component {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          {this.props.data.map((fruitList, index) => (\n            \n              {fruitList.map((fruit, i) => (\n                \n                  {fruit}\n                \n              ))}\n            \n          ))}\n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n\n}\nThe thing is, using a class here doesn't give you any benefits over a Functional component. The class literally only has a render and a return, so all it really does is requires you to write a few more lines of code.A quick note on the keys in this example - When you render an array of items in React, you need to give each member of the array a unique key. React uses these keys to optimize changes to the DOM.\n\n\nconst FruitTable = props => (\n  \n    \n      {props.data.map((fruitList, index) => (\n        \n          {fruitList.map((fruit, i) => (\n            \n              {fruit}\n            \n          ))}\n        \n      ))}\n    \n  \n);\n\nconst data = [\n  ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'],\n  ['grape', 'pear', 'orange'],\n  ['plum', 'watermelon', 'canteloupe'],\n];\n\n;\n\nTry it yourself in this CodePen.So, when should you use Functional Components, and when should you use class Components?If you don't need anything special - if you are purely just returning JSX to render - use a functional component.But:If you need your component to be stateful - that is, if you need the ability to use setState to respond to changes, use a class.\n\nIf you need lifecycle methods - if you need to do something when the component mounts, or receives props, or unmounts - use a class.\n\nIf you need a ref - that is, a reference to the DOM element rendered by the component, use a class.\n\nAnd only if you don't need any of those things - use a Functional Component.Functional Components are a great example of what people talk about when they say that React is \"declarative\", or gives us a declarative API. Rather than telling the DOM how to render the UI we want - which nodes to change, and how - we can use JSX to \"declare\" how we want the markup to look, and React alters the DOM accordingly. A Stateless Function literally makes your UI a function of the props you pass it, which is a declarative, functional approach to creating views."},"lectures/02-further-react-info/08-Functional-Component-Exercise.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/08-Functional-Component-Exercise.html","title":"Functional Components Exercise","keywords":"","body":"Exercise!Now that we've learned about functional components, is there any place we can apply them?Look through the projects you've done so far.

Let's get technical!React class components provide several lifecycle methods that you can use to control your application based on the state of the UI.These methods happen automatically - but you can call them to modify them.These methods are called at specific points in the rendering process. You can use these methods to perform actions based on what's happening on the DOM.componentDidMount, for example, is called immediately after a component is rendered to the DOM.\n\ncomponentWillUnmount is called immediately before a component is removed from the DOM.\n\nSome common uses of lifecycle methods are making asynchronous requests, binding event listeners, and optimizing for performance.Component lifecycle methods:constructor()\n\ncomponentWillMount()\n\ncomponentDidMount()\n\ncomponentWillUnmount()\n\ncomponentWillReceiveProps()\n\nrender()\n\nshouldComponentUpdate()\n\ncomponentWillUpdate()\n\ncomponentDidUpdate()\n\nLet's go through them. Again, you don't need to write these - only if you want to change something in them.Here they are in a diagram -  Open this image in a new window next to this one, and follow along as we go through the methods.constructor()This is something we've already seen when we were learning state. Like any JavaScript class, the constructor method is called when a component is instantiated (when it's first rendered).In a class constructor, you must call super before you do anything else. So a React component constructor in its most basic form looks like this:constructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n}\nYou don't need to define a constructor if that's all it does, though. This happens automatically when your component is invoked. A common use of the constructor is to initialize state using the props passed to the component - as we have been doing!constructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.state = {\n    fruits: props.fruits,\n  };\n}\nThis constructor sets the initial fruits state of the component to the fruits prop passed to the component. Then, using setState, your user can add fruits, delete them, or whatever else your component allows.Another common use of the constructor method is to bind class methods.When a method is \"bound\" to a component, it means that when the method is invoked, this will refer to the component, and not to the context that invoked the method. So, if you pass a component's method to a child component from a parent component, you can be sure that this.setState will set the state of the parent component if the method is bound to it.In JavaScript classes, methods aren't bound by default. So, if you pass a component's method to a child component without binding it, it can lose its context, and not behave the way you intended. Here's an example:class FruitTable extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      fruits: props.fruits,\n    };\n    this.addFruit = this.addFruit.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  addFruit(fruit) {\n    this.setState(prevState => ({\n      fruits: prevState.fruits.concat(fruit),\n    }));\n  }\n\n}\nNotice that in the constructor, this.addFruit is bound to the class - this.addFruit = this.addFruit.bind(this);Now, if we pass this.addFruit to a child component as an onChange callback, it will be bound to FruitTable and will update its state when it's invoked.Again, you don't need a constructor in every React component, but if you need to initialize state by props or bind methods, the constructor is where you do it.componentWillMount()This method is called immediately before a component is rendered to the DOM. You generally won't need to use this method. Advanced use-cases like server-rendering are usually the only ones in which componentWillMount is needed.componentDidMount() and componentWillUnmount()The componentDidMount method is called once, immediately after your component is rendered to the DOM. If you want to make an AJAX request when your component first renders, this is where to do it (not in the constructor, or in componentWillMount). componentWillMount shouldn't be used for server requests because it may be invoked multiple times before render in future versions of React. Side effects should be avoided in the constructor, and so server requests shouldn't be made there. The accepted answer on this Stack Overflow from a member of the React team at Facebook gives more detail. In the following example, we fetch data from the server, then set the state of the component using the response.componentDidMount() {\n  fetch(`http://api.com/${this.props.id}`)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(data => this.setState(prevState => ({ data })));\n}\nAnother common use for componentDidMount is to bind event listeners to your component. You can then remove the event listeners in componentWillUnmount. In this example, we bind and unbind an event listener for a drag-drop component.class FruitTable extends React.component {\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    document.addEventListener('dragover', this.handleDragStart);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    document.removeEventListener('dragover', this.handleDragStart);\n  }\n\n  handleDragStart(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    this.setState(prevState => ({\n      dragging: true\n    }));\n  }\n\n}\nrender()This is the one method that every React class component must have. In render, you return JSX using the compoment's props and state. You should never set state in render - render should only react to changes in state or props, not create those changes. The following component renders a single prop and a single state key - a car model and a speed. Once this component is mounted, its speed state will go up by 1 every second. You can try it out yourself on CodePen.class Car extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n\n    // sets initial state to either the `speed` prop, or 0 if the `speed` prop\n    // is not passed to the component\n    this.state = {\n      speed: props.speed || 0,\n    }\n\n    // binds this.incrementSpeed to class\n    // this way when it's used as a callback for `setTimeout`\n    // `this` refers to the `Car` class\n    this.incrementSpeed = this.incrementSpeed.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    // calls this.incrementSpeed after one second\n    window.setTimeout(this.incrementSpeed, 1000);\n  }\n\n  incrementSpeed() {\n    // sets the `speed` state to one unit higher than it was previously\n    this.setState(prevState => ({ speed: prevState.speed + 1 }));\n\n    // recursive method\n    // increases speed by 1 again after one second\n    window.setTimeout(this.incrementSpeed, 1000);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        This {this.props.model} is going {this.state.speed} miles per hour!\n      \n    );\n  }\n\n}\nTo break down what's happening in this component:constructorThe initial state is set to either the speed prop, or 0 if the speed prop is not passed to the component.We bind this.incrementSpeed to the class, so that when it's used as a callback for setTimeout, this refers to the Car class.componentDidMountUse window.setTimeout to call this.incrementSpeed after one second (1000 ms).incrementSpeedthis.setState(prevState => ({ speed: prevState.speed + 1 }));: The speed state is set to one higher than it was previously - we add one.window.setTimeout(this.incrementSpeed, 1000): The incrementSpeed method is recursive) - it invokes itself as the timeout callback. After one second, window.setTimeout will call this.incrementSpeed again - the speed will go up by one, and a new timer will be set to do it again.componentWillReceiveProps(newProps)This method is called any time your component receives new props. It is not called with the initial props when your component initially mounts. If you need to change the state of your component based on changes in the props, this is where you do it. In a simple app, you generally won't need componentWillReceiveProps.shouldComponentUpdate, componentWillUpdate, componentDidUpdateThese methods are called when a component's props or state change, and are generally used for performance optimizations. React is quite fast by itself, and you usually don't need to concern yourself with these methods outside of a large app with many dynamic components."},"lectures/02-further-react-info/10-Unidirectional-Data-Flow.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/10-Unidirectional-Data-Flow.html","title":"Unidirectional Flow","keywords":"","body":"Unidirectional Data FlowLet's start with a video:\n\n\n\n\nSo, in React applications, data usually flows from the top down.

Let's look at a search filter as an example.

Using unidrectional data flow, of course! If I create a container component to hold both the filter value and the filtered list, I can hoist the state to the container so it's available to all the children. It will then be trivial to display it in the child components. The data will flow like this:Child componentsNow that I know the components I need, the state I need, and where everything needs to be, I can start writing some code. First, I'll create the child components. I can use Functional components, since they won't need to hold their own state.const FruitList = props => (\n  \n     {props.fruits.map(fruit => {fruit})}\n  \n);\n\nconst FruitFilter = props => (\n  \n    Filter these Fruits: \n    \n   \n);\nFruitList renders an unordered list (ul) which contains an array of li elements, each with a single fruit string. FruitList uses array map to convert the array of fruit strings in our data to an array of fruit li elements to render. Using map to convert data arrays to arrays of UI elements is a common pattern you will use, and see used, in React.FruitFilter renders a single input. Its value and onChange callbacks will both be set by the container component.Conatiner componentMy container will be a class with a few methods I'll use to initialize and update the state of the two child components.\nIn the constructor, I'll initialize the state:constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      // initialize the fruit list to the full list passed in props\n      fruitsToDisplay: props.fruits,\n      // intialize the filter value to an empty string\n      filterValue: '',\n    };\n  }\nI'll need a method to update the state when the filter value changes. This method will store the filter state, and filter the list of fruits to display. I'll pass this change handler to the filter component to react to user input.handleFilterChange(event) {\n  event.preventDefault();\n  const filterValue = event.target.value;\n  this.setState((prevState, props) => {\n    // remove fruits that don't contain the filter value\n    const filteredFruitList = props.fruits.filter(fruit =>\n      fruit.toLocaleLowerCase().includes(filterValue.toLocaleLowerCase()));\n    // return new state with the filtered fruit list and the new value of the filter\n    return {\n      fruitsToDisplay: filteredFruitList,\n      filterValue,\n    };\n  })\n}\nFinally, I need to render my child components.render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\nThe full container component looks like this:class FruitContainer extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      // initialize the fruit list to the full list passed in props\n      fruitsToDisplay: props.fruits,\n      // intialize the filter value to an empty string\n      filterValue: '',\n    };\n    // bind the context of our filterChange event handler\n    this.handleFilterChange = this.handleFilterChange.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  handleFilterChange(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    const filterValue = event.target.value;\n    this.setState((prevState, props) => {\n      // remove fruits that don't contain the filter value\n      const filteredFruitList = props.fruits.filter(fruit =>\n        fruit.toLocaleLowerCase().includes(filterValue.toLocaleLowerCase()));\n      // return new state with the filtered fruit list and the new value of the filter\n      return {\n        fruitsToDisplay: filteredFruitList,\n        filterValue,\n      };\n    })\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n\n}\nAll of the data is hoisted to the top of the tree in the container, and I pass it to the child components.You do: Also display the fruits that do not match the filterOnce you have your data structured well, it's easier to add features to your applications or make changes to them. Because all of our data lives at the top of the tree, we can send it where we want. The full code for the fruit filter is available at this CodePen. Fork the CodePen and add a feature. Add another child component to the FruitContainer that displays the fruits that do not match the filter value (this should be all the items that are not in the fruitsToDisplay list).FinallyIt's important that you think through your applications before you start writing code. It's often helpful to sketch out your app, and identify the components you need, the state you need, and where that state needs to live. Use the unidirectional data flow pattern - hoist your state toward the top of the component tree so it's available to the children that need it."},"lectures/02-further-react-info/11-Immutable-Data.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/11-Immutable-Data.html","title":"Immutable Data","keywords":"","body":"Immutable Data TypesSomething that is immutable is something that cannot be changed. In JavaScript, objects and arrays are mutable - they can be changed. A simple example of object mutation (note that I declare the object as a const, but it is still mutated):const anObject = {\n  foo: 'bar',\n};\n\nanObject.foo = 'barrrrrrr';\nI just changed anObject's value - I mutated it. This happens because JavaScript assigns objects and arrays to variables by reference. Changing their properties does not change their reference, and so they are mutated.Here's an example of mutating an array:const anArray = ['oneFish', 'two fish', 'red fish', 'blue fish'];\nanArray.pop(); // new value of anArray is ['oneFish', 'two fish', 'red fish']\nIn React, components' state and props are to be treated as immutable. But wait, we have to change the state, right? Yes, yes we do. Just never do it by mutating the state directly.Don't do:handleChange(event) {\n  this.state.myPieceOfState = event.target.value;\n}\nThis method directly mutates the component's state. When state is updated, we want our components to re-render with the new data. When state is mutated, React may not be aware of the change, and re-render may not happen.The good news is that you already know how to avoid this. React makes it easy: components have a setState method that allows us to update the state without mutating it. Behind the scenes, React is returning a fresh copy of the state (with a new reference) with the updated data when you use setState.Do:handleChange(event) {\n  this.setState(prevState => ({\n    myPieceOfState: event.target.value,\n  }));\n}\nComponent props should not be changed within a component at all. There is no setProps method. Props change above the component in the tree and are passed down. Refer to the unidirectional data flow lesson for more on this.Immutability everywhereTreating data as immutable makes application development easier. Data mutations can be hard to track (say, in a debugger). Though vanilla JavaScript does not have immutable object and array types, you can still develop JavaScript applications that treat data as immutable.Immutable methodsAs mentioned above, array.pop() mutates the array. You can achieve the same effect without mutating the array, however.\nThe array methods map, filter, and reduce return modified copies of the array and don't mutate the originals. To pop an array without mutating it, you could:const newArray = anArray.filter((item, index, originalArray) => index !== originalArray.length -1);\nSimiliarly, there are ways to change data in objects that don't mutate the originals. ES6 Object.assign is great for this.const newObject = Object.assign({}, anObject, { foo: 'barrrrr' });\nNotice that the first argument to Object.assign is an empty object literal - this means that the keys from anObject and the third argument will be copied to a brand new object (with a new reference), which will be returned as the value of newObject.Immutable librariesWhile it's certainly possible to write vanilla JavaScript applications and maintain immutable data types, it can get tedious, and if you're not careful you can accidentally mutate your data. There are several mature JavaScript libraries that provide immutable data types and/or immutable methods that can make maintaing immutable data types trivial. One of the most popular is Immutable.js from Facebook, which provides immutable data types like List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record - and methods for making changes to your data like set, get, delete, update, etc. With a library like Immutable.js you don't have to think about immutability - just use the types and methods provided, and the library takes care of it for you.Additional Resources:JavaScript immutable libraries\n\n"},"lectures/03-router/00-router-introduction.html":{"url":"lectures/03-router/00-router-introduction.html","title":"React Router","keywords":"","body":"Browser History MechanicsWe're going to look at old, traditional browser history mechanics (like back\nand forward) and see how they're built for an old internet where people\nbrowsed between lots of different pages.

The URL is a URL to a\ndifferent page.\n\nClick the link to \"Seattle\" and notice how your browser goes blank, loads\nanother page and shows you the next article for UW.\n\nClick on several more links and keep an eye out to notice when the browser\ngoes blank and totally loads a new page.\n\nHold down your mouse on the back button. You'll see a drop down menu\nshowing every page you've been on.\n\nHolding down the back button to look at your browser history should show\nsomething like this:Browser history mechanics are built for going back and forward between\ndifferent pages. Browsers have the back and forward buttons for users. These\nactions are also available to us in JavaScript. We can write JavaScript programs\nthat invoke window.history.back() and window.history.forward().Pages can be all on the same site, or on many different sites. Browsing pages on\none site is like viewing different articles on Wikipedia, or viewing different\nmovie pages on IMDB. Browsing pages on different sites is like using a search\nengine to look up a restaurant, looking at Yelp's website, going back to the\nsearch engine website, and looking at a restaurant's official website. The\nbrowser is still visiting different pages they're just on different sites.It's important to specifically note what a \"page\" is. A page is a whole HTML\nfile that your browser downloads and displays. You know you're navigating\nbetween two different pages when you see your browser screen go blank, then\nslowly load in a totally new page.We're going into detail about what a page is in order to draw contrast to how\nmodern web applications don't use multiple pages like they used to. Modern web\napplications are now often what we call Single Page Applications.Before we get into Single Page Applications, let's talk about URL routing.What is URL Routing?Routing defines what content is displayed when someone visits a certain a\nURL. If I go to http://github.com/ I would expect to see GitHub's homepage.\nIf I got to http://github.com/login I would expect to see a login page. Each\nof these URLs is a route. A route pairs a URL with the content that should\nbe displayed for that URL. You should be able to visit a webpage, copy the URL\nto a friend, and they should end up viewing the same page.Let's look at an example of how content is routed by URLs by looking at the\nGeneral Assembly homepage.Go to https://generalassemb.ly/. Interact with the menu in the top bar on\nthe right. You should see options for things like \"On Campus,\" \"Locations,\" and\n\"About.\" Click on the different links to pages and notice the URLs that you end\nup at. Hover over the links to see their URL to save yourself from actually\nnavigating off the page.This table shows the path for each URL. The path of a URL is everything\nafter the domain name. In this case the path is everything that appears\nafter \"https://generalassemb.ly\" in the location bar of the browser. The /\npath is a special path called the root. It's the homepage.Compare the paths in the URLs and get a sense for how URLs are routed to\ncontent. Websites URLs are general split into succinct, descriptive,\nhierarchical categories. Notice how going to /locations takes you to a page\nshowing all campus locations, then each specific location is in a hierarchy\nunder that, like /locations/london and /locations/singapore.\n\nURL Route\nContent\n\n/\nHomepage\n/about\nGeneral Information\n/education\nShows all local upcoming courses\n/education/web-development-immersive\nWDI course details\n/education/user-experience-design-immersive\nUX course details\n/locations\nShows all global GA locations\n/locations/london\nShows London-specific location information\n/locations/singapore\nShows London-specific location information\n\n\nYou can see that URLs route users to content. When someone types in a URL\nthey are ultimately shown content associated with that URL.Have you ever tried to send someone a link to what you're looking at on Google\nMaps and then when they click on your link they end up looking at something\ncompletely different? That's a great example of bad URL routing. (Google Maps\nis actually much better about this these days.) URLs should represent the\nmain content of the page you're looking at!Old web sites that spread their content across multiple pages use URLs to route\nusers to different pages. Websites can also use different URLs with hashtags to go to different content on the same page...For example - Open a new tab in your browser and navigate back to that Wikipedia article for\nCafe Allegro in Seattle.Hover over the \"1. History\" link in the Contents section\n\n\nLook in the lower left of your browser to see the URL the link leads to\n\nNotice the URL looks like wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_Allegro#history,\nspecifically note the hashtag #history\n\nClick the history link and notice how it scrolls you down in the same page. This still counts as a route - it's navigating you to a section on the page.\n\nModern Single Page ApplicationsNow, consider webpages where depending on what you click on, the actual content of the page dynamically changes. Modern web apps serve just one\npage and they change parts of the contents of the page, without\nhaving to reload the entire page or send users to another page.Websites that serve up only one page and change the content of the page\ndynamically without reload the page are called Single Page Applications.Open your browser and navigate to Gmail (or whichever email site you use):When you load Gmail, you see your inbox\n\nYou can start instant messaging a friend in a sidebar\n\nYou can start to compose a new email to your manager to request time off\n\nYou can search for an email with flight information\n\nYou can browse through more email to make sure you've talked your manager\nabout getting time off and aren't just disappearing for a week\n\nThis all happens on one page! The page never refreshes. The chat bar with your\nfriend never disappears as you compose an email and search through your inbox.Gmail fits the definition of a Single Page Application. Gmail loads one\npage just once and that page replaces content dynamically to show you many\ndifferent things. That single page changes its content dynamically without\nreloading or sending you to another page. It's great!Consider the benefits of a single page application:It's fast. Users don't have to wait for a page to reload over and over.\n\nIt's persistent. You can have a chat window open in one corner and keep\ntalking to a friend as the rest of Gmail switches between showing you your\ninbox, an email, or email search results.\n\n"},"lectures/03-router/02-modern-browser-history.html":{"url":"lectures/03-router/02-modern-browser-history.html","title":"Modern Browser History Mechanics","keywords":"","body":"Single Page Apps Break Old History Mechanics!Now here's the catch, and why we went into such detail about browser history\nmechanics and defining what exactly Single Page Applications (SPAs) are - Single Page Applications break the initial design of Browser History Mechanics.The back and forward actions were built specifically to go back and\nforth between different pages. Since single page apps only change the content\nof themselves without actually sending users to different web pages the notion\nof back and forward is lost.When users press the back button in a Single Page Application they go back\noff the one page, completely out of the Single Page Application.Imagine being on Wikipedia, going to Gmail, going through several views of\ndifferent email inboxes, search results and then pressing the back button.Go to wikipedia.org\n\nType in www.gmail.com (or whichever) to check your email\n\nClick on one email\n\nSearch your email for something\n\nOpen that email\n\nClick 'back' in your browser to go back to the search results\n\nWait - you end up back at wikipedia.org\n\nGmail and most mail apps are a Single Page Applications - despite the content changing, you are always on gmail.com. Because of this, pressing the back button will take back to the previous URL they were on - in this case, Wikipedia - when really, the user just wanted to go back\nto their email search results.Introducing Modern Browser History MechanicsSo - developers need to have their fast loading web applications, but somehow still have the 'back' button work.Web Developers, browser vendors, and users (even if they don't know it) all love Single Page Applications; they're a great experience that the community is embracing. To facilitate these and still have things like the 'back' button work, a few years ago, people got together in committees and devised a way to upgrade the old\nbrowser history mechanics to accommodate modern SPAs.The modern HTML5 specification (published October 2014) introduced new browser\nhistory mechanics to make Single Page Applications easier to browse 'back' and\n'forward', even through they actually stay on the same page. How? HTML5 introduced .pushState and .replaceState functions that allow web pages\nto save custom history data to the browser. Applications like Gmail can use\nthese functions to manually save custom browser history. For example, Gmail can use .pushState to put in the browser history that a user is on their search results page, so if they go into an email and click 'back', they get back to the search page - instead of off gmail.com completely.A bit more technically, when someone goes from\ntheir inbox to a specific email, Gmail can use .pushState to save in the browser information\nabout what the user is currently doing in the application. Now when the user\npresses the 'back' button, the browser gives the saved information back to\nGmail and Gmail brings back the content the user was last looking at.RecapHere's a summary of what we've learned today:Single Page Applications and Browser History MechanicsSingle Page Applications are websites that serve only one web page, then\nchange the content of that page dynamically, without refreshing.\n\nOld browser history mechanics support back and forward operations that\ntraditionally keep track of history as users move between different pages.\n\nSince modern Single Page Applications keep the user on one page without\nrefreshing old browser history back and forward mechanics don't work\nwell with modern applications - so HTML5 changed the rules of how 'back' and 'forward' can work.\n\n"},"lectures/03-router/03-react-router-intro.html":{"url":"lectures/03-router/03-react-router-intro.html","title":"React Router Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Intro to React RouterObjectivesReview how websites use URLs to route content\n\nReview what it means for a website to be a Single Page Application\n\nIntroduce React Router's main features: routing, components, history\n\nUse React Router to map URLs to components\n\nUse React Router to create links to different pages\n\nIt's great that HTML5 introduced new browser history mechanics to make it easier\nfor us as developers to build Single Page Applications, and it's important to know what's going on under the hood.However, on an important note - we're actually not going to\nbe using these new features directly ourselves!Instead, we'll use a tool called\nReact Router that bundles this all together, so we don't have to worry about it.For an intro to React Router, watch this video:\n\n\n\nReact Router is a third party library that makes it easy for us to route URLs - not to different pages, but by dynamically loading different components on the same page as the user navigates to different URLs.

Saving the library as a dependency\nmakes it easy for us to copy our project to another machine and just run\nnpm install to install all of the dependencies for our project.\n\nreact-router-dom is the official name of React Router\n\nSo, in summary, we're telling npm install to find the library package called\nreact-router-dom, install the package, and save the name of our package to our\nfile that keeps track of all the packages for our project.If you don't use the --save flag then npm install will still find the\npackage and download it. It just won't save the package to your package.json\nfile so you can easily install all your saved dependencies later on if you move\nto another machine.In Your TerminalNow let's make the dentist project. In your terminal, type:$ create-react-app dentist-website\n$ cd dentist-website\n$ npm install --save react-router-dom\n$ npm start\nYour browser should open to http://localhost:3000/ and you'll see the standard\n\"Welcome to React\" message with a fancy rotating atomic icon. create-react-app\ncreates several files for us in a directory called src.

If you still don't see changes after a manual refresh then  something could be wrong.

It's like a sanity check.\n    Make sure you can do simple things first. Don't start with complex things; many things can go wrong when you make complex changes. Prove to yourself the small changes work, and you'll save yourself headaches debugging large\n    complex changes.\n  \n\n\n\nCreate Custom HomepageLet's get rid of the standard \"Welcome to React\" page and replace it with our\nown Dentist Website Homepage. Continue editing App.js. Gut most of the HTML\ncontents, and delete the import statement for the logo.svg which we won't use.The App.js file contains one component that our whole App will live inside\nof. Remember that React components have a render(){ ... } function that\ndefines what the component will look like when it is rendered on the webpage.\n  **Repetition for good practice reminder:**\n\n  The render function alway has to return *at most* one top-level element. It's\n  common to wrap everything in your component in a `` to make sure you\n  satisfy this constraint.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo...I added one  that says Dentist Website and added a paragraph with some\nshort welcome text.

You must fix this before continuing. Always:\ndo simple things before doing complex things!"},"lectures/03-router/06-dentist-router.html":{"url":"lectures/03-router/06-dentist-router.html","title":"React Router - Adding in Router","keywords":"","body":"Displaying Pages IndividuallyTry manually deleting two of the three components so only one component is left\non the page at a time. You should see your webpage update with just that\ncomponent. This is effectively what React Router does. We can configure React Router\nso that it's aware of which component we want to show on the screen, and React\nRouter will swap the components out so that only the correct one is shown at a time.Now that we've proven to ourselves that we're able to show each of the\ncomponents on the main page, it's time to hook them up to Router.Creating RoutesHere's the general syntax for creating routes. React Router uses some of its own components to define how URLs are routed\nto your components and to create links to those routes. You must have one \ncomponent that wraps itself around multiple  components. Each \ncomponent has two pieces:path - defining the URL path that leads to the component.\n\ncomponent - defining\nwhat component users will see when they navigate to the path.\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThere are three other important things to note here:This goes in place of your existing component calls of  or  (depending on which syntax you went for).\nThe first route for the homepage at the root URL path / uses a\nspecial extra exact attribute before defining the path. The exact attribute\nmeans the component associated with the route will only be shown if users are\nat exactly that URL path. If you forget to include the exact keyword then\nwhen someone navigates to /courses they will actually see two components,\nbecause / is a partial match for /courses.\nNotice that all of the  components are wrapped inside one . Like render, the\n element requires that it only has one direct child element. If you don't\nwrap the routes with a , the page will appear blank, and you'll have to\nopen your JavaScript console to see that there's an error being logged to the\nconsole. Like so -\nPro tip: It's a good habit to check the console for errors whenever your\napp is not behaving as expected.Import StatementsIn order to use the React Router components, you'll need to import them. This\nimport syntax allows us to grab several specific components out of the\nreact-router-dom library at once. So far we've used Router and Route.The Router component is actually called BrowserRouter\ninside the library package, but we'll use the as keyword to rename it to\nRouter so it's easier to remember.While we're here, we'll also import a third component, Link, which we'll get to in a minute.import {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Route,\n  Link\n} from 'react-router-dom';\nFully RoutedHere's how the imports and all the components look like together for our dentist\nwebsite:App.jsimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Route,\n  Link\n} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nimport Home from './Home';\nimport Procedures from './Procedures';\nimport Contact from './Contact';\n\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n          \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\nNavigate to the RoutesNow that everything is hooked up you can manually enter different URLs and\nsee how your page appears. If you go to http://localhost:3000/, you should\nsee just the homepage. If you go to http://localhost:3000/procedures, you should\nsee just the procedures page. If you go to http://localhost:3000/contact,\nthen you should see just the contact page.Check it!Make sure that React Router is routing from each URL to the proper component\ncorrectly.\n\nDouble check to make sure that the home page doesn't display at the\nsame time as another component. If the homepage is shown while you're at the\npath to /procedures or /contact then you probably did not write the exact\nkeyword when you defined the / Home route.\n\nDebugging Common ErrorsLet's intentionally make an error. Delete the exact keyword off the Home\nroute. Navigate to the /procedures page and the /contact page again and\nsee how the components are displayed. You should see the content of the\nhomepage and the content for one of the other pages at the same time, with\nthe home page on top.Now add the exact keyword back to the home route and notice that the pages\ndon't double up any more.Two common errors:\n1. If the page appears blank, open the JavaScript console to see if there are\n  errors. Chances are you have a typo somewhere or forgot to make sure the\n   only has one child element. Remember, wrap all of your  components\n  in one .\n2. If multiple components appear on the page at the same time there's\n  something with how you've routed URLs. Make sure you use the exact\n  keyword on the root path / and make sure there are no duplicate URL paths\n  defined anywhere.Adding a Nav SectionGreat, now our site is up and running! We can manually type in URLs and see the\ndifferent pages.Although... users never really type URLs, do they? We should probably have links at the top of the page so we can just click on\nthings. We could build this ourselves, but we don't have to! Remember that Link component we imported from React Router?Just like links in HTML, we can wrap  tags around whatever text that we want to display to the user to click on. The pieces of this are: - creates  tags and automatically integrates\nmodern HTML5 browser history mechanics for the Single Page Application. It\nhas one attribute:\n\nto - what path to navigate to when the user clicks the link\n\nWe'll add one \n  component that leads to each of our different content pages.Go to Home Page\nSee Our Procedures\nContact Us!\nDid you notice that we don't reference components here? We simply make links for users to click that connect to URLs, and the Router section in the code handles the actual component changes.We can include those links in a  element at the top of our page.\nIt will stay on the page permanently, and the different components will be\nswapped between each other below it. There's actually nothing special about\nthe  element. It behaves exactly like a .  Is just a\nsemantic element that gives your HTML more meaning when people read it.So, our web app now looks like the left image - but do you see a difference between the left and the right?There's one slightly annoying thing about React here - React strips out whitespace between elements. If we write  components next to each\nother, even if they're on new lines, React strips all of the whitespace\n(spaces, returns, tabs...) between them and squishes them all together.We\nmust insert a space manually by writing {' '} in order to get spaces between\nour links.So instead, here's how we'll write the links. Nothing has changed except that we've added the space:Go to Home Page{' '}\nSee Our Procedures{' '}\nContact Us!\nAnd now the nav bar will have spaces like it should.Final CodeHere's what our final App.js looks like:class App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n            Go to Home Page{' '}\n            See Our Procedures{' '}\n            Contact Us!\n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\nCheck it out!

As third-party software developers, we can access an organization's API and use their data within our own applications.What if you want a Google map embedded in your web app to show people where they can visit you? You aren't going to make that map yourself, so somehow you have to call Google. Well, Google has an API you can call to get the map information - all you have to do is send a request to the API that Google provides, and Google gives you a google map back that you can use.API stands for \"Application Program Interface\" and technically applies to all of software design. The DOM and jQuery are actually examples of APIs! Since the explosion of information technology, however, the term now commonly refers to web URLs that can be accessed for raw data.\n  Q: Why do we care?\n  *Why recreate data when we don't have to? Think about past projects or ideas that would be easier if you could pull in data already gathered elsewhere.*\n\n  *APIs can provide us with data that would we would otherwise not be able to create ourselves.*\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we move into building single page applications, now is the perfect time to start understanding how to obtain data on the client side and then render it on the browser.API ExplorationThere are a variety of APIs available on the internet. To call an API, send a request to a URL, and that API returns data to your program. You can pull data from anywhere that offers an API.You can make this request as specific as you'd like - each web app out there offers different options for their API. You just have to find out from them what you can request!Here are just a few examples of APIs that you can use. Check it out - the left column is the common name you might know. The right column is the URL you, in your program, would send a request to. You can click those URLs to see what each call would return.\n\nWhat's the API?\nSample URL - you call this\n\nGiphy's API: request a list of all funny cats\nhttp://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC\nOMDB's API: request list of Game of Thrones Season 1 episode info\nhttp://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Game%20of%20Thrones&Season=1\nThe Star Wars API: request R2-D2 info\nhttp://swapi.co/api/people/3\nMarkit Digital's API: request current Apple stock info\nhttp://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/Quote/xml?symbol=AAPL\n\n\nDoes the JSON look unreadable in the browser? If you're using Chrome, install the JSON View plugin.Hmmm.Can you think of any websites you go to that pull information from other places, so they probably use an API?"},"lectures/04-further-information/02-data-types.html":{"url":"lectures/04-further-information/02-data-types.html","title":"API Response","keywords":"","body":"Return FormatNo user likes when they're on a page that takes forever to load. If your web app has a google map, a list of movies from OMDB, and a Spotify catalog, that's a lot of information! You want it returned as quickly as possible so that users aren't waiting forever for your page to load.All this information, from all these browsers and all these servers, has to travel through the network. That's almost certainly the slowest part of the request cycle. We want to minimize the bits. There are times when we just need the data, and for those times, we want a concise format.All data sent via HTTP are strings. Unfortunately, what we really want to pass between web applications is structured data (i.e., arrays and hashes) (because it makes much more sense to us!). Thus, native data structures can be serialized into a string representation of the data. Serializing is taking a giant string of data and turned it into something readable and useful.There are two major serialized data formats that you will typically encounter: JSON and XML.JSONJSON stands for \"JavaScript Object Notation\" and has become a universal standard for serializing native data structures for transmission. It is light-weight, easy to read and quick to parse. JSON looks like this - it's easily readable and information is separated with braces {} and commas.{\n  \"users\": [\n    {\"name\": \"Emily\", \"id\": 0},\n    {\"name\": \"Richard\", \"id\": 1},\n    {\"name\": \"Matthew\", \"id\": 2}\n  ]\n}\nRemember, JSON is a serialized format. While it may look like an object, it needs to be parsed so we can interact with it as a true Javascript object.XMLXML stands for \"eXtensible Markup Language\" and is the granddaddy of serialized data formats (itself based on HTML). XML is fat, ugly and cumbersome to parse. It remains a major format, however, due to its legacy usage across the web.XML has an idea of open tags and close tags - just like HTML.\n  \n    Emily\n  \n  \n    Richard\n  \n  \n    Matthew\n  \n\nComparing those, you can probably see that most developers favor using a JSON API, if available. Conveniently, many APIs publish data in multiple formats and let you specify which you'd like. For example,\nhttps:///api/index.php?output=json or\nhttps:///api/index.php?output=xmlChances are good that most major content sources you follow online publish their data in some type of serialized format. Even Marvel Comics publishes an API. Look around for a \"Developers\" section on major websites. Or, if you'd like a cheat sheet you can try the Programmable Web API Directory or the Public APIs Directory.AuthenticationWhile the majority of APIs are free to use, many of them require an API \"key\" that identifies the developer requesting data access. Some APIs, like Spotify's music catalog, might seem like they should be available for anyone to access, but imagine if PayPal had an API that shops could request your money from. For example, imagine a shop like Etsy would call PayPal when you buy something. You'd want Etsy to have to prove they were Etsy, right? You don't want anyone to be able to pretend to be Etsy, go to PayPal, and charge you $500. You'd want Etsy to have to somehow authenticate to PayPal, right? You'd want PayPal's API to require Etsy to prove that they are in fact Etsy and they are in fact allowed to call the API to charge you money.The way this is done is by giving Etsy a private key to use at PayPal that only Etsy knows, so every time Etsy makes a request to PayPal, Etsy can say, \"Hey, I'm requesting this; here is my proof that I'm allowed to.\"Many APIs require a key. This is done to regulate usage and prevent abuse. Some APIs also rate-limit developers, meaning they have caps on the free data allowed during a given time period.Let's look. Try hitting the Giphy API. You can just click these - it's documentation to show you how it's done.No key: http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat.\n\nYou get back, in the center of the string: \"error_code\":\"invalid_api_key\" (and, on a note, it's in JSON formatting). The rest of the string is just more information.Now try with a key: http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC\n\nYou get back the list of funny cats - still JSON formatting.It'd be more readable if we added new lines between cat gifs in the list, but that's not automatic.Important note!When you are calling APIs that require a key, it's up to you to store those keys somewhere private. They are the only proof that you are you and you are allowed to call that API, after all.For example, it is very important that you not push your API keys to a public Github repo.**This is especially true when working with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here's an example of a stolen key horror story."},"lectures/04-further-information/03-fetch.html":{"url":"lectures/04-further-information/03-fetch.html","title":"fetch","keywords":"","body":"Introducing fetch()So... we know what an API is. Now what?How can we use an API to dynamically manipulate the DOM with the given data? We can use fetch(). In then past, these have been called AJAX requests. As you'll come to learn, this allows us to build single page applications that do not require refreshes.AJAX, which stands for \"Asynchronous Javascript and XML,\" is the method through which we are able to make HTTP requests. The standard requests we will be making are GET POST PUT PATCH and DELETE.\n\nType of Request\nWhat's It Do?\n\nGET\nRead ('give me movie names from your database')\nPOST\nCreate ('here's a new movie for your database')\nPATCH\nUpdate ('hey, this movie has a new title'))\nPUT\nUpdate ('hey, this movie totally changed')\nDELETE\nDelete ('that movie is so bad you should just take it out of the database')\n\n\nThe browser packages this together using fetch() and sends it off to a server. The server then listens to your request and provides a response. It looks something like this:When you browse to your favorite websites, your browser is making a request and the server provides a response. fetch() allows us to perform the same type of requests over a network. Imagine fetching weather information and rendering it on your website. Perhaps you want to create a real-life Pokedex? You can use fetch() to build these applications.Taking a look at fetch in actionThat was a lot! Let's take a look at fetch() in action. Imagine we want to fetch() a randomly generated poem from Shakespeare. Good thing that there is an API for that, right? This API provides us with the ability get a poem using the following URL:http://ShakeItSpeare.com/api/poem\nWe're then provided a response that looks like the following:{\n    poem: \"This Is Just To Say\n    I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox\n    and which you were probably saving for breakfast\n    Forgive me, they were delicious\",\n    author: \"William Carlos Williams\",\n    markov: 2,\n    lines: 7\n}\nOkay, so that isn't a poem that the API would provide (Shakespeare is quite long for an example!), but it is an example of the JSON that you will get from that endpoint.We can fetch this JSON easily using Javascript. Let's open JSBin. Make sure to show the Javascript and Console tabs.Put this in, then hit 'Run' in the top right corner.ES6 Syntaxlet poemApi = 'http://ShakeItSpeare.com/api/poem';\nfetch(poemApi)\n  .then((response) => {\n    return response.json()\n  }).then((json) => {\n    console.log('JSON from Shakeitspeare.com', json)\n  }).catch((ex) => {\n    console.log('An error occured while parsing!', ex)\n  });\nLet's break this API call down into a few steps.let poemApi = 'http://ShakeItSpeare.com/api/poem':\nFirst, we define our API URL to fetch from\nfetch(poemApi): We call fetch on that API URL.\n.then((response) => {\n  return response.json(): We take the response when the server provides it. We return the response.json()\n.then((json) => {\n  console.log('JSON from Shakeitspeare.com', json): We take that json and console.log it.\ncatch((ex): If an error occurs, we catch it and log it.\nThat's as simple as fetch is. While there are other ways to handle the response (such as html or blob), this approach makes writing requests to APIs and other network calls in Javascript easy.Production Warning! It is important to note that while this is an ES6 standard, some browsers such as Internet Explorer do not support it; yet Edge does. You may need a polyfill for live projects. If you need a polyfill for a production project, Github's polyfill is very popular."},"lectures/04-further-information/04-fetch-exercise.html":{"url":"lectures/04-further-information/04-fetch-exercise.html","title":"fetch exercise","keywords":"","body":"Codealong!It is time for you to build a very simple component that posts a movie title and poster after searching for it. We'll do this using the OMDB API. For practice, create a new react application. Before doing so, challenge yourself to a mini quiz.\n\n  Q: Which React.Component method should API calls be made from?\n\n  > `componentDidMount()`. Per the [React documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount), _If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request._\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Q: What does it mean to make `GET` request?\n\n  > We are asking the server to send us data to read. To `GET` means to \"read.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFetching from OMDB in a React ComponentNow, let's use the fetch() API directly inside of a React Component to render movies. We will create a re-usable component that can individually fetch and render information about a movie from OMDB. The official React documentation tells developers that any network requests should be placed inside of the componentDidMount method. Let's start building a component with this method defined.Do this in any of the projects you have - just be sure to import the file and render it there!import React, {Component} from 'react';\n\nclass Movie extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n      /* nothing here... yet! */\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n        \n        \n    );\n  }\n}\nWe can now tell our component to fetch a movie and then set it to our state. We can then render an individual movie. We do this by adding the fetch() call inside of componentDidMount(). Calling setState then triggers a re-render inside of our component.Important: the value of the this keyword in JavaScript changes depends\non what function is being executed. It has a relative value according to what\nfunction it's inside of. The fetch() call involves many callbacks with\nseveral different functions. In order to preserve the initial context of our\nReact component, we need to create a new variable base to keep track of the\noriginal value of the this keyword. Saving the original value of this to\nbase allows us to access methods like this.setState() through\nbase.setState() all throughout the different functions. Also importantly - this variable can be called anything at all; we're just calling it base here. The important bit is just to save \"this\" to \"base\".import React, {Component} from 'react';\n\nclass Movie extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    // save a reference to `this` because the value of `this` will change\n    // inside the different callback functions.\n    var base = this;\n\n    // fetch a movie\n    fetch('http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Tron')\n      //then parse response to json\n      .then(function(response) {\n        return response.json()\n      // then use that json\n      }).then(function(json) {\n        console.log('Parsed JSON', json);\n        base.setState({ movie: json });\n      // catch an error if one occurs\n      }).catch(function(ex) {\n        console.log('Parsing JSON failed', ex)\n        alert('Error! ' + ex);\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n       let title = this.state.movie.Title;\n    return (\n        \n            I really like {title}!\n        \n    );\n  }\n}\nFood for thought: Why are we using let for the title?Note: Do you see that base.setState? That's another way of setting state, versus declaring movie as a state in the constructor.Finally, let's get a movie - any movie - and render it.import React, {Component} from 'react';\n\nclass Movie extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    var base = this;\n      fetch('http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=' + this.props.movieSearchQuery)\n      .then(function(response) {\n        return response.json()\n      }).then(function(json) {\n        console.log('Parsed JSON', json)\n        base.setState({ movie: json });\n      }).catch(function(ex) {\n        console.error('Parsing JSON failed', ex)\n        alert('Error!

Just the functionality.\n\nMake sure it has at least four components.\n\nMake sure you use Router\n\nUse ES6 syntax\n\nWe don't have a database set up - if you need data, feel free to hardcode only a little (just enough to get the idea) or use fetch to call an API.\n\nSome ideas:https://www.airbnb.com/\n\nhttps://citymapper.com/boston\n\nhttps://reddit.com\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/\n\nJust a note on best practices:Each component should be in a file unto itself. Don't put multiple components into one Javascript file.\n\nDo not automatically render elements on the DOM. You may find examples of ReactDOM.render() but you should avoid this at all cost; this was an older technique in past versions of React.\n\nRemember that state represents the state of your user interface component.\n\nState can trigger changes in props or props can come from parent components.\n\nStick to functional programming techniques if at all possible. By that we mean, use built-in methods if available such as .forEach() and .map()\n\nIf you are rendering a list of child components (such as a ul -> li list), each individual child component needs a unique id for React to work with it. This is so React can identify each element uniquely if needed\n\nDon't ever let yourself think that State and Props are the same thing. They aren't!\n\n"},"lectures/04-further-information/08-heroku.html":{"url":"lectures/04-further-information/08-heroku.html","title":"Heroku","keywords":"","body":"Deploying a React AppBefore moving forward, it is strongly suggested that you have a working knowledge of Git. Read the Git basics guide or try Git if you have no experience with Git before moving forward.ObjectivesDiscover what Heroku is, why it is useful, and register an account\n\nInstall the Heroku Command Line Interface & use it (a Platform as a Service) to deploy a React application\n\nFine-tune your React application for the web\n\nWhy are we learning Heroku?We're using create-react-app to make our app, but that's local. Heroku's incredibly popular forWe can use Heroku to deploy a React application to the internet in under five minutes. Heroku also provides five free applications to every user.What is Heroku?Heroku is a cloud platform that allows developers to quickly deploy applications to the internet. It is a cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) that is used as a web application deployment service. Heroku, one of the first cloud platforms, has been in development since June 2007. It is currently owned by Salesforce. We can use Heroku to deploy a React application to the internet in under five minutes. Heroku also provides five free applications to every user.Before we start diving in, you should register an account at Heroku. You don't need to pay for anything unless you desire to. Once you register, confirm your account, and sign back in, you will be re-directed to the Heroku dashboard at https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps. You can view all of your applications on the dashboard once they are deployed.Heroku Command Line InterfaceNow, you need to download install the Heroku CLI. You can download the installer from the provided link or brew install heroku from your terminal application. This tool is designed to make your life easier as a developer by integration Heroku application development and deployment directly into command line.Note: You may need to restart your terminal session - just in case - before moving forward. Why? Because you just installed software to modify your terminal's environment and your environment variables may not be updated yet.Now, you should login to Heroku using the command line. Do so by typing in heroku login. You'll be prompted with the following questions followed by an authentication message:Enter your Heroku credentials.\nEmail: adam@example.com\nPassword (typing will be hidden):\nAuthentication successful.\nNow, use new create-react-app command in your terminal to create an app. Next, change directory -- cd -- into the directory.create-react-app your_app_name_here\ncd $your_app_name_here\nNow, we'll need to initialize a Git repository inside of our React application. The Heroku CLI requires Git to handle versioning for deployment.git init\nNext, we'll create a heroku application using something called the create-react-app-buildpack.heroku create your_app_name_here --buildpack https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git\nYou'll see Heroku output something similar to the following:Creating app... done, ⬢ your_app_name_here\nSetting buildpack to https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git... done\nhttps://your_app_name_here.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/your_app_name_here.git\nNow, we need to add all of the files and changes that we may have added. In theory, we'll have actually built an application. For our purposes, we are going to use what has been provided with create-react-app. We'll use git to add all of the files and commit our changes.git add -A\ngit commit -m \"My first React app on Heroku! wow!\"\nFinally, we can push our app to the Heroku. By doing this, Heroku will put your app together on the internet.git push heroku master\nAfter seeing lots of command line wizardry happen before your eyes you should see Heroku print out a URL to the console. You could copy that URL to visit it or you can type in heroku open. Either way, you will be taken to your react application.Congrats - you've now deployed your React app live! Good job.Deploying your Project LiveNow that you have seen how to deploy your application live, it is time for you to push your project live. Since you have created an application already using create-react-app, you can skip that step. Before pushing live, you'll need to make a few minor adjustments to make everything look great.Routing clean URLs with React RouterBy default, React Router (not included) uses hash-based URLs like https://example.com/index.html#/users/me/edit. This is nice & easy when getting started with local development, but for a public app you probably want real URLs like https://example.com/users/me/edit.Create a static.json file to configure the web server for clean browserHistory URLs with React Router:{\n  \"root\": \"build/\",\n  \"clean_urls\": false,\n  \"routes\": {\n    \"/**\": \"index.html\"\n  }\n}\nGetting around CORS with Heroku ProxyIf you have connected to an API that has CORS enabled, you can proxy XHR requests from the React UI in the browser to API backends using Heroku. Prevent same-origin errors when CORS is not available on the backend.Configure using Proxy Backends from the static site buildpack. Add \"proxies\" to static.json:{\n  \"proxies\": {\n    \"/api/\": {\n      \"origin\": \"${API_URL}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\nThen, point the React UI app to a specific backend API using the CLI:heroku config:set API_URL=\"https://api.example.com\"\nExcersiceDeploy your most recent project live to Heroku. Do so by:Initializing a Heroku app in your project's directory.\n\nUse Git to add and commit your changes.\n\nPush your changes to Heroku using git push heroku master.\n\nView your project live online using heroku open.\n\nFurther ConsiderationsCompanies like General Assembly using PaaS solutions to deploy quickly. In fact, GA uses Heroku for their web front end.\n\nWhy might this be awesome? What advantages do you see to using PaaS vs building your own virtual servers?\n\nWho might you trust with all of your secret data, keys, and environment variables? Co-workers? Friends? Your grandma?\n\nDocumentationhttps://blog.heroku.com/deploying-react-with-zero-configuration#new-zero-configuration-experience\n\nhttps://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\n\nhttps://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack#quick-start\n\n"},"lectures/04-further-information/09-self2.html":{"url":"lectures/04-further-information/09-self2.html","title":"Second self exercise","keywords":"","body":"Self exercise #2!Practice makes perfect - let's keep practicing.This is an open ended exercise.
