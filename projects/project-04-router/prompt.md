# You Do: Implement Router (20 minutes) #

You've been told your blog needs to have five pages:
- Homepage
- Main blog
- Favorite movie
- Favorite food
- About page

You already have the "Main blog" page.

Task:

- Create each page in your blog project (hint: These will be seperate .js files).
  - These pages don't have to have much content - just the header at the top saying what the page is and a paragraph description of your choosing.
- Route to each.
