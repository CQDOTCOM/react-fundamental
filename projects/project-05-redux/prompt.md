# You Do: Implement Redux (20 minutes) #

Still using Fetch and OMDB, recreate the Netflix carousel with your 10 favorite movies.

- Put this in the "favorite movies" page in your blog.
- Use redux to send data down.
- Input component that makes the fetch request; your component will tell redux ‘here’s data.’
- Update carousel.
