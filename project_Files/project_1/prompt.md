# You Do: A Blog Post (25 minutes) #

Let's have some practice creating a React component from scratch. How about a blog post?

- Create a __post__ object literal in __src/index.js__ that has the below properties:
  - __title__
  - __author__
  - __body__
  - __comments__ (array of strings)
- Render these properties using a Post component.
- The HTML (or more accurately, JSX) composition of your Post is up to you - as in, fill the title, author, body, and comments with any text you'd like.
