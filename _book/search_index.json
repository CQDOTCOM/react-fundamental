This means that React can also co-exist with other Javascript frameworks, letting the other frameworks handle the models and controllers and having React sort out the views.\nSome History\nFor a quick rundown, React was...\n\nFirst used by Facebook in 2011.\nThen Instagram in 2012.\nWent open source in May 2013.\n\n\nIf you want to get an in depth taste of what React's all about, here's an introduction from React.js Conf 2015.

Run:\n$ npm i -g create-react-app\n\nNow that it's installed, let's move to the directory wherever you keep all your code and use the tool to start a React app. We're calling the directory \"hello_world\", since that'll be our first project.\n$ create-react-app hello_world\n\nThe tool creates a new directory for our app, so let's move into it...\n$ cd hello_world\n\nUse npm start to start a server that will serve your new React application!\n$ npm start\n\n\nHere you have now set up a Hello World app that you will continue working on during this lesson's exercises.\n\nAfter running $ npm start, you can view the app at http://localhost:3000\nOne especially cool thing that we'll see is that this tool sets up our application so that the webpage automatically refreshes whenever we save any file in the directory. It's awesome.\nYou can look in the directory and see the structure that create-react-app provides for us. It looks like this:\n├──README.md\n├──  favicon.ico\n├──  index.html\n├──  node_modules\n├──  package.json\n└──  src\n    ├──  App.css\n    ├──  App.js\n    ├──  index.css\n    ├──  index.js\n    └──  logo.svg\n\nMost of the important files are in the /src directory. Specifically, we'll be using App.js and index.js.\n\nStop / Catch Up / Investigate\nIf you finish up early, review and play with the code in /src/App.js, /src/index.js and index.html\nTake some time and look at what's been generated.

Since they're so encapsulated, components make code reuse, testing, and separation of concerns easy.\nIdentifying Components\nTake a look at CraigsList. Identify the visual \"components\" the website is comprised of. We suggest drawing this out on paper! So something like this...\n\nAs you're drawing this out, think about the following questions...\n\nWhere do you see \"nested components\"? Where do you not?\nAre there any components that share the same structure?\nOf these similar components, what is different about them?\n\nSo -\nWhat does a component look like?

In this example, we are creating a \"Hello\" component.\nextends Component\nThis is the React library class we inherit from to create our component definition. So, we are creating a new Component class called \"Hello\" that is inheriting from React.Component.\nrender()\nEvery component has, at minimum, a render method. The render function is what, well, renders the component to the screen. From this function, we return what we want to display - in this case, a Hello World! header.\n\nNote! That header tag is not HTML - it's something called JSX, which you'll see on the next page. For right now, though, it's acting as HTML for us that will be rendered to the screen.\n\nexport default Hello\nThis exposes the Hello class to other files which import from the App.js file (in our case, index.js). The default keyword means that any import whose name doesn't match a named export will automatically revert to this. Only one default is allowed per file.\nCheck it out!\nIf you switch to your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000, you can see your \"Hello World!\" header. This app dynamically reloads each time you save, so you can check your changes at any point.\nSo -\nLet's look into that header that got rendered.\n"},"lectures/01-react/05_jsx.html":{"url":"lectures/01-react/05_jsx.html","title":"JSX","keywords":"","body":"Wait - What's that HTML doing in my Javascript?\nThis is currently the contents of our app.js file:\n// bring in React and Component instance from React\nimport React, {Component} from 'react'\n\n// define our Hello component\nclass Hello extends Component {\n  // what should the component render\n  render () {\n    // Make sure to return some UI\n    return (\n      Hello World!\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Hello\n\nLet's talk about the header that's returned. It looks an awful lot like HTML, but it's not. Often times we write out React components in JSX.\nWhat's that?\nJSX VIDEO HERE\nSo, JSX allows us to write code that strongly resembles HTML. It is eventually compiled to lightweight JavaScript objects. We're returning some JSX that creates a header with 'Hello World' in it for our component to render.\n\nReact can be written without JSX. We won't be doing this, but if you want to learn more, check out this blog post.\n\nChallenge: Greet the day!\nIn your component, return multiple lines. Instead of just the Hello World! header, also add a line below it that would print out \"It is time for tea.\" in an h3.\n\nHint: Remember, the return statement in render can only return one DOM element.

Being good programmers, we've separated our class into a different file.

Instead, it calls the Virtual DOM. How is that different?\nVIRTUAL DOM VIDEO here\nSo for React, the virtual DOM is a staging area for changes that will eventually be implemented.\n\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about the Virtual DOM, check this video out.\n\nEvery component has, at a minimum, a render method that generates a Virtual DOM node to be added to the actual DOM.\nThe contents of this node are defined in the method's return statement using JSX.\nThe .render function takes two arguments:\nReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n)\n\n\n is the component to render - inside this component in our App.js file, we returned the content to render - those Hello World and tea headers (written in JSX).\ndocument.getElementById('root') finds the DOM element to append that content to. This can be any element on the page; here, we're simply appending it to root.\n\nWhen our index.js is called, our virtual DOM is compared to the regular DOM, and only the 'root' element on the page updates.\n\nSide note: What is  written in? JSX! Whenever you use a self-closing tag in JSX, you MUST end it with a /, like  in the above example. It's just one of the rules!\n\nHello World exercise - You do!\nCode along: Calling our component\nUpdate your index.js file to have these three changes - deleting the .css import and changing both the Component name that's imported and the Component name that's called.\n\nCheck it out!

In our component definition, we will change the Hello World! to Hello {this.props.name}. This is a reference to that data via as a property on the props object, rendering the prop that was passed in.\nYour index.js should now look like:\nclass Hello extends Component {\n  render () {\n    return (\n      \n        Hello {this.props.name}\n        It is time for tea.\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nIn the above example, we replaced \"world\" with {this.props.name}.\n\nCheck it out!

Change the top of App.js to include the new class:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n// Load in Comment component\nimport Comment from './Comment.js'\n\nNow, we'll need to render it inside of our Post component.\n{this.props.comments[0]} is what is currently in our App.js. Now, instead of this line, we'll want to call the Comment component (which returns a paragraph with the comments, so it will do the same thing!). Edit that line to start with a call to the new component and a comment explaining it:\n\n\nBut what just happened? We made a call to a component inside another component. Technically, we just nested components. Instead of calling App.js from index.js as well as Comment.js from index.js, we still are only calling App.js from index.js. Then, inside App.js, we're using some of the props and simply passing the comments prop on to Comment.js. So the flow of the props looks like this:\n\n\nNote: We could put all of our code in one file, but it's considered a good practice to break components out into different files to help practice separation of concerns. The only downside is we have to be extra conscious of remembering to export / import each component to where it's rendered.\n\n"},"lectures/01-react/12_nested_components_challenge.html":{"url":"lectures/01-react/12_nested_components_challenge.html","title":"Nested Components Challenge","keywords":"","body":"You Do: Add Nested Posts To Blog\nThis is great so far - but our stegosaurus is actually outsourcing the blog, so each post has multiple authors.

React may seem very confusing at first with all of the jargon so let's break everything down:\n\nReact is a framework created by developers at Facebook. It is aimed at being the 'view' of your Javascript application. It focuses on creating a component based architecture that focuses on the individual pieces of your user interface.\nThe Virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the DOM, or an abstraction of the DOM. React doesn't apply your changes to the DOM directly. While it creates and manipulates elements, it does so through custom React objects. The results of that are then rendered to the DOM. This keeps you from having to focus on changing the constant state of a  tag.\nJSX is a standard that React uses to represent HTML elements as XML tags. It looks like a template language but is much more powerful. Each JSX tag represents a React Element and a React Class is composed of multiple elements. You express your visual user interface through nested XML tags that can render additional components.\nProperties are arguments passed into a Component, as if they were arguments to a function. The component can then use this data to render or pass it on to another component.\n\nLet's put something together really quickly to re-inforce what you've learned so far. \nCodealong\nWe're going to spin up yet another React app. Use create-react-app to create mordor application. \n\nRefer to the Initial Setup to remember how to do this; make sure you stop the currently running application first!\n\nOpen up your ./src directory in your favourite text editor.\nInside of ./src folder, create a new React Component called Mordor.js. \nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Sauron from './eye.png';\nimport './Mordor.css';\n\nclass Mordor extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      // soon\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Mordor;\n\nWhere it says \"soon\", you're going to create a  to represent Mordor. Inside of Mordor is an  that represents Mount Doom, where Frodo is to throw the One Ring of Power into lava for destruction (ONCE AND FOR ALL).\nThe JSX inside your Mordor component's return function will therefore look something like this:\n\n  \n    Ring destroyed: {this.props.doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing}!\n  \n\n\nNotice that this JSX has properties, or props. When a React Component's render() method is called, it takes any properties that were supplied to the component when it is instantiated. Later, we're going to call the Mordor class from inside App.js. When we call the component, it looks like this:\n\n\nHowever, we also want to pass a prop into the component, right? The Mordor component needs to know whether or not Frodo has the ring. So our call to instantiate the component is instead going to look like:\n\n\nNotice the value that we have assigned to this React Component's prop of doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing. We can supply a custom argument here that the React element will receive for use as props. Eventually, Frodo throws the Ring of Power into the volcano. Then the next time we call the Mordor component, we could instead send a props like so:\n\n\nWe can make the value of the prop anything we'd like, just as long as the key matches. In the Mordor component, it's looking for Ring destroyed: {this.props.doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing}!, so we need to be sure to call the component and pass in a prop with a key of doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing.\nLet's take a look at this in action. Save your changes to your Mordor component. It should look something like this (feel free to be creative).\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Sauron from './eye.png';\nimport './Mordor.css';\n\nclass Mordor extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n          \n            Ring destroyed: {this.props.doesFrodoHaveTheOneRing}!\n          \n        \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Mordor;\n\nOnce you're done, open the ./src/App.js. We're going to render Mordor! We can do so by replacing the interior of  with the first version of Mordor. Open your Web browser and you'll notice your component has loaded. \nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\nimport Mordor from './Mordor.js'\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n          Welcome to React\n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nNow, let's wrap things up by modifying the properties of your Mordor component... because it is time to defeat Sauron!\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\nimport Mordor from './Mordor.js'\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n          Welcome to React\n        \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nCheck Yourself: Virtual DOM\nTake a moment to consider the following scenario: it is the year 2007 and you are hard at work on a website. ECMAScript5 is the hot new rave and you're working hard to create user interface components using vanilla Javascript. How would you create the React Components using vanilla Javascript for organization? Here are a few things to consider:\n\nThe use of prototype for inheritance vs the ES2015 model of Class\nPure DOM manipulation using createElement and getElement... methods.\nBuilding constructor objects that contain an element (or el) that is rendered using a render() method. \nHow would you handle the updating of properties going into the component? How would this affect your constructor?\n\nAs you consider this scenario, think about the ease that the Virtual DOM provides you by directly handling the creation and updating of DOM elements on the page. React creates special elements on the Virtual DOM and then elements are rendered for you with ease so you don't have to create individual React Elements to build each React Component.\n"},"lectures/01-react/14_state.html":{"url":"lectures/01-react/14_state.html","title":"State","keywords":"","body":"State\nSo we know about React properties, and how they relate to our component's data.\n\nThe thing is, props represent data that will be the same every time our component is rendered. What about data in our application that may change depending on user action?\nThat's where state comes in..\n\nSTATE VIDEO HERE\nValues stored in a component's state are mutable attributes.\n\nState is similar to props, but is meant to be changed.\nLike properties, which we access with this.props.val, we can access state values using this.state.val\nSetting up and modifying state is not as straightforward as properties and instead requires multiple methods. It involves explicitly declaring the mutation, and then defining methods to define how to update our state...\n\nLet's switch gears back to our Hello world project\n\nBe sure to switch which is running locally!\n\nLet's modify our earlier HelloWorld example to be a new MoodTracker component. There will be a mood displayed, and eventually a user will click a button to indicate on a scale of 1-10 how much of that mood they are feeling.\nFirst, now that we're going to have a state, we're going to have an initial value. When we call classes, a good way to make initial values is by creating a constructor: constructor (props) {}. Constructors say, \"When you call this class for the first time, do this.\" Without a constructor explicitly defined by us, when we first call a class the method will just do the default. That's why we didn't need a constructor before - we weren't doing anything differently than the normal default for the class.\nThe first thing we always put in a constructor is a call to super(), which just says \"You should still do the normal initialization for this class.\"\nAfter this, we can define what's new. What's new for us is that when the class first gets called, we want to set an initial state. We can do this by calling this.state, another built in function. Inside of this, we can define any state variables we'd like.\nWe'll call our state moodPoints and set its initial value to 1.\nAt the top of your App.js file, add the constructor function to the class.\nclass Hello extends Component {\n\n  constructor (props) {\n      // make call to parent class' (Component) constructor\n      super()\n      // define an initial state\n      this.state = {\n        moodPoints: 1 // initialize this.state.moodPoints to be 1\n      }\n    }\n\n  // what should the component render\n  render () {\n    ....\n\nNow, let's make sure we display that to the user. Still in App.js, in your render method, we'll let the user know:\n\nYou are this happy: {this.state.moodPoints}\nfor how many mood points they are at  (note how similar this call is to a prop call!).\n\n\n\nAll together, the render for our App.js can now look like:\nreturn (\n  \n    Hello {this.props.name}\n    You are {this.props.age} years old\n    You love {this.props.animals[0]}\n    On a scale of 1-10\n    You are this happy: {this.state.moodPoints}`\n  \n)\n\n\nCheck it out! If you browse to http://localhost:3000, your state will be displayed.\n\nOk, we set an initial state. But how do we go about changing it?\n\nWe need to set up some sort of trigger event to change our counter.\n\nWe will create a button that the user can click, which will increase their mood by one.\nFirst, we will create a method to increase the mood that the button will call. Under the constructor, above the render method, add this method:\nincreaseMood(e) {\n  this.setState({\n    moodPoints: this.state.moodPoints + 1\n  })\n}\n\nNote that we call this.setState to change the state.\nNow, we'll create the button to call it. A button will be displayed to the user, so we'll add it to the render function. When the user clicks it, we'll call the increaseMood() function.\n  render () {\n    // can only return one top-level element\n    return (\n      \n        Hello {this.props.name}\n        You are {this.props.age} years old\n        On a scale of 1-10\n        You are this happy: {this.state.moodPoints}\n         this.increaseMood(e)}>Cheer up!\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nAltogether, your App.js file now looks like this:\n// bring in React and Component instance from React\nimport React, {Component} from 'react'\n\n// define our Hello component\nclass Hello extends Component {\n\n  constructor (props) {\n      // make call to parent class' (Component) constructor\n      super()\n      // define an initial state\n      this.state = {\n        moodPoints: 1 // initialize this.state.counter to be 0\n      }\n    }\n\n    increaseMood(e) {\n      this.setState({\n        moodPoints: this.state.moodPoints + 1\n      })\n    }\n\n  // what should the component render\n  render () {\n    // Make sure to return some UI\n    return (\n      \n        Hello {this.props.name}\n        You are {this.props.age} years old\n        You love {this.props.animals[0]}\n        On a scale of 1-10\n        You are this happy: {this.state.moodPoints}\n         this.increaseMood(e)}>Cheer up!\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Hello\n\n\nCheck it out! If you browse to http://localhost:3000, your button now changes the state.\n\nWhenever we run .setState, our component runs a diff between the current DOM and the virtual DOM node to update the state of the DOM in as few manipulations as possible; it only replaces the current DOM with parts that have changed.\nThis is super important! Using React, we only change parts of the DOM that need to be changed.\n\nImplications on performance.\nWe do not re-render the entire component like we have been in class.\nThis is one of React's core advantages\n\nChallenge: Count to 10\nAfter 10 clicks, the user should see the counter reset to 1.\nMore on what should & shouldn't go in state\n"},"lectures/01-react/15_state_exercise.html":{"url":"lectures/01-react/15_state_exercise.html","title":"State Exercise","keywords":"","body":"You Do: Implement State (20 minutes)\nLet's implement state in our Blog by making body a mutable value.\n\nRemember to switch the running application!\n\n\nInitialize a state using a constructor() method for our Post to set a initial state.

It's a lot, so we're going to want it to be editable.\nThis is what our list will look like when we're finished:\n\nLet's get started!\n\nBecause this is a new exercise, be sure to close the running application in terminal first.\n\nBack up to the main directory you're storing your projects in.

If you browse to http://localhost:3000, you should have a fresh react app.\n\nMake sure that as you go, you frequently check the site to ensure your changes are all reflecting accurately!\n\n\nFirst, the basic list.\nLet's change the name of the component in App.js to something helpful, like MyList. Then, we'll change the contents of the HTML to have a header and the start of a list.\nThis looks like:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass MyList extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n           Things I should stop procrastinating:\n        \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyList;\n\n\nRemember to change the component call in index.js!\n\nNow, our webpage displays an empty list.\nWe've learned that we should make new files for each component, and that different functionalities should be split into different components. Let's make a component for ListItems. The return from this component can simply be Make the list! so we are starting with something in this list.\n\nRemember to use an export statement at the end of the new file to make the code in this file available elsewhere in our application\n\nDon't forget to import it into App.js, and then call the component with  under the existing header (in place of the existing list item)!\n\n\nAt this point, our app looks like this:\n\nSide note - let's just quickly format it a little nicer!\nSince we'll be looking at this for a while, let's make it less of an eyesore. Feel free to change the index.css file to be anything you'd like; on mine, I've centered the text and given it a light green background. You can grab my .css file here:\nSecond, props.\nThis is a great start - we've already nested components (ListItem inside of MyList). Now, let's add some props to make this useful and check that current list item off!\nLet's first just pass a prop into ListItem from MyList. We'll call the prop something simple, like doThis. I'm pretty hungry; I'll pass in a value of \"buy ice cream.\"\nThen, in ListItem, we'll add a list item instead of the existing one that renders the passed in prop.\nNow, we have in App.js:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport ListItem from './ListItem';\n\nclass MyList extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Things I should stop procrastinating:\n        \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default MyList;\n\nand then in ListItem.js:\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass ListItem extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        {this.props.doThis}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default ListItem;\n\nOur app now looks like this:\n\nThird, render different items in an array\nIf we want to make this a truly extensible list, we could create an array of items, then pass them into props through the ListItem component, then render out each item. Let's do that now.\nBorrowing from a bonus exercise earlier, the easiest way to do this is by using the map function. A map is like a for loop or a dictionary. With map, you make a new variable and iterate through each item in an array with it. It looks like this:\nlet  = .map( (local_Variable_Name_to_Loop, index) => (\n  \n))\n\nWe:\n\nWill, in the MyList component, have an array of items for the list, uncreatively called items.\nCreate a variable to refer to the map, todoItems.\nWant to run through this array, one item (this could be any name you'd like) at a time, and call the ListItem component for each.\nThe ListItem component will return a line of JSX, creating a list item for each one.\nWe can later refer to this list by just calling the variable in JSX like any other, e.g. {todoItems}.\n\nHere is the map function that will do this for us, that we'll put in the MyList component.:\nlet todoItems = this.props.theList.map( (item, index) => (\n      \n    ))\n\nLet's also actually create that array! In MyList, create an array variable called items.

In order to do so, we'll need the following variable to represent the new item we'll be entering:\n\nnewItem, to hold the new item the user inputs\nMake a new state, initializing newItem to a blank string\n\nHint: You need a comma between states\n\n\n\n\nWe'll also need two additional functions to represent the following changes in state:\n\nnewItemChange, for when we type characters into an input field and change the value of newItem\nWe'll need to get the current value of the input field and set state accordingly\nCreate this function (with a prop of 'e' like in ClearList) and in it, change the state of newItem to e.target.value - this will be the value returned from the form.\n\n\n\n\naddItem, for when we submit the form\nWe'll need to make a copy of toDoItemArray, push the newItem, set state and clear newItem\nCreate this function (with a prop of 'e') and in it, create a new variable initialised to the value of the array saved in state. Then, use yourArray.push(); to push the item saved in state onto the array. Set the newItem state back to an empty string, and set the toDoItemArray state to your new array.\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, add this form to your render method.\n\n   this.newItemChange(e)}\n   value={this.state.newItem}\n  />\n   this.addItem(e)}>Add it!\n\n\n\nNotes:\n\nSince JSX functions are callbacks, we can assume that any function called via an event can accept a callback argument with the event. We pass this in as e to newItemChange and addItem\nWe can use onChange on the input field to trigger an event when the text in the box is changed\n\n\nCheck it out!

You can create user interface components that extend from React.Component. These have a built-in lifecycle that accepts data and can trigger automatic re-rendering whenever that data is updating. In a React Component, an update in either the State or Props will trigger the method cascade that can lead to a render(). \nBest Practices\n\nEach component should be in a file unto itself. Don't put multiple components into one Javascript file.\nDo not automatically render elements on the DOM. You may find examples of ReactDOM.render() but you should avoid this at all cost; this was an older technique in past versions of React.\nRemember that state represents the state of your user interface component.\nState can trigger changes in props or props can come from parent components.\nDon't ever let yourself think that State and Props are the same thing.

We'll try to make it fun and easy.\nWhat is ES6?\nES6, also called ES2015, refers to a set of language features that were added to the ECMAScript standard in 2015.\nCool, what's ECMASript? It's a standard that JavaScript tracks. For our purposes, it is JavaScript.\n2015? Yes, that was a while ago now, but browsers are still in the process of adopting the new features. There were more additions to JavaScript in 2016, also known as ES7. These changes weren't as drastic, or perhaps exciting, as those of ES6, which is why you don't hear much about ES7. More changes are set to be adopted this year, which will be ES8/ES2017. The entire set of modern features from ES6 and on is sometimes referred to as \"ESNext\".\nWhy do I care?\nThe language features of ESNext are awesome. They enable you to write more concise, easier-to-read and easier-to-maintain code.\nThat sounds great, but can we just do React for now? If you look at the React docs, you'll see they are written with the assumption that the reader is familiar with ES6. Modern JavaScript language features (ES6, ES7 and beyond) are widely used in the React development community. Whether you're reading blog posts, studying source code or browsing questions on Stack Overflow, you're going to see them in use frequently. So, it's very helpful to have an understanding of them. And it makes your code more fun to write! (For example, there's some syntax that looks like a rocket ship, and using that rocket ship, you have much less you actually have to write out).\nIf some browsers don't support ES6, why does anyone use it? Great question with a simple answer: Babel. Babel takes your ES6 (and beyond) code and transpiles it into browser-friendly ES5. If you use Create React App to start a project, Babel is built in, so your production build is ready for deployment. And browser support for new language features is coming to browsers. All of the JavaScript features we'll talk about in this lesson except module imports can be used right now in Chrome - try them out in the dev-tools console!\nIs JSX ES6? No. JSX is the XML/HTML-like syntax you can use in your JavaScript when creating React components (and there are other frameworks that use JSX as well). Babel can transpile JSX to plain JavaScript, though - just like it transpiles ES6 JavaScript to ES5.\nESNext features we'll cover here:\n\nconst and let\nArrow functions\nObject literal shorthand\nTemplate literals\nImports and modules\n\nSome of the features from ES6 and beyond we will not cover:\n\nPromises\nAsync/Await\nGenerators\nClasses\nArray spread\nArray and Object destructuring assignment\nObject rest spread\n\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/02-ES6-ConstLet.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/02-ES6-ConstLet.html","title":"Const and Let","keywords":"","body":"const and let\nconst and let are new keywords for declaring variables. Where before you would have declared\nvar x = 1;\n\nYou can now declare\nconst x = 1;\n\nor\nlet x = 1;\n\nconst is short for \"constant\", which means a const's assignment can't change. This does not, however, mean that a const is immutable. JavaScript assigns by reference. This means that if you change a property of an object, or add an item to an array, its reference, and therefore its assignment don't change. If I assign an object literal as a const variable like this:\nconst anObject = {\n  hi: 'hello',\n};\n\nI can then add a key to it, mutating its value:\nanObject.newKey = 'some value';\n\nThe new value of anObject is now:\n{\n  hi: 'hello',\n  newKey: 'some value',\n}\n\nThis is valid, because anObject's reference doesn't change.\nHowever, if I assign a const to a primitive type (a string, number, or boolean, for example), I can't change its value at all.\nconst hi = 'hello';\nhi = 'goodbye';\n\nThe code above will throw an error, because I attempted to change the reference to a const.\nThis CodePen illustrates this. Click the little red exclamation point to see the error.\nThat is what let is for. The value and reference of a let variable can change, so this will run with no errors:\nlet hi = 'hello';\nhi = 'goodbye';\n\nOpen the console (at the bottom of the window) in This CodePen and you'll see that the JavaScript runs, and \"goodbye\" is logged to the console (to view the console, click the 'console' tab at the bottom).\nWhen declaring variables using ES6 syntax, if you need to declare a variable whose value will not change, declare it as a const. If the variable's value will or might change, declare it as a let.\nlet, like var, can be reassigned as much as you like. Why use let at all, then, when you could just use var? Since var in javascript is scoped to the nearest parent function, using let is more predictable and straightforward.\nHere's an example of the difference between how let and var are scoped from MDN:\nfunction varTest() {\n  var x = 1;\n  if (true) {\n    var x = 2;  // same variable!\n    console.log(x);  // 2\n  }\n  console.log(x);  // 2\n}\n\nfunction letTest() {\n  let x = 1;\n  if (true) {\n    let x = 2;  // different variable\n    console.log(x);  // 2\n  }\n  console.log(x);  // 1\n}\n\nYou can see this in action in This CodePen - open the console to see the difference.\nWith more predictable scope, let variables are easier to keep track of visually than vars, and less likely to introduce bugs to your code.\nExercise:\nHere's a tricky one. Look at your blog project - the index.js file. You have:\nvar post = {\n  title: \"Dinosaurs are awesome\",\n  authors: [\n    \"Stealthy Stegosaurus\",\n    \"Tiny trex\",\n    \"Iguanadon Ivory\"\n  ],\n  body: \"Check out this body property!\",\n  comments: [\n    \"First!\",\n    \"Great post!\",\n    \"Hire him!\"\n]\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  ,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\nShould that post variable be a let or a const?\n\n Did you think about it? Do you have an idea? Then the answer is...\n  The answer is `const`. We want to show one post which will be displayed\n  constantly. The one post should never change.\n\n  Now, the comments might change. People should be able to add or remove their\n  own comments. Remember that `const` only refers to what the variable `post`\n  references. We're still allowed to modify the values inside of the object.\n\n  Using `const` will guarantee that the `post` object is never swapped out\n  for an entirely other blog post object. Using `const` will still allow us\n  to modify the values of the `title`, `authors`, `body` and `comments` inside\n  the constant object.\n\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/03-ES6-Arrow.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/03-ES6-Arrow.html","title":"Arrow","keywords":"","body":"Arrow functions\nThe arrow function => is a more concise syntax for declaring functions. It looks like a little rocket arrow, in fact, and something that cool isn't usually in javascript. Arrow functions are not only different in syntax, however - their scope is also different from a regular function declaration.\nBasic Syntax\nUsing the function keyword, to create a function that adds two to an argument, you'd write:\nfunction addTwo(num) {\n  return num + 2;\n}\n\n\nHere, we are naming our function addTwo and it takes in one parameter, num.\n\nUsing arrow syntax, you'd write:\nvar addTwo = num => {\n  return num + 2;\n}\n\n\nHere, we declare our function as a variable: var AddTwo. To pass in the variable, we put it after an equal sign: var addTwo = num. Then we have the arrow function and the actual function definition.\n\nIf there are multiple parameters passed into an arrow function, you put them in parentheses, just like a traditional function. Before, using the function keyword, you would write:\nfunction multiply(x, y) {\n  return x * y;\n}\n\nWith the arrow syntax, it's:\nvar multiply = (x, y) => {\n  return x * y;\n}\n\nDo you remember const?\nAnything that was a var in ES6 is better practice to write as a let or a const.\nYou can write functions using const or let as well. This can be helpful to know that the function's assignment later cannot change (in the case of const) or explicitly declared as can (in the case of let). Using let or const with a function is not necessary, but in some cases it's good practice (more on that later).\nSo now with the arrow syntax, we had:\nvar addTwo = num => {\n  return num + 2;\n}\n\nAnd we can simply change the var to a const.\nconst addTwo = num => {\n  return num + 2;\n}\n\nAnother thing to note is that if the function does nothing except a return, we can simplify it even further:\nconst addTwo = num => num + 2;\n\n\nnote that we dropped the brackets and return keyword\n\nCompare this ES6 declaration with our original function!\n// traditional\nfunction addTwo(num) {\n  return num + 2;\n}\n\n// now\nconst addTwo = num => num + 2;\n\nYou can play with arrow functions in this CodePen. Remember, you can also use ES6 syntax in the Chrome dev-tools console, and your Create React App projects are transpiled with Babel, so you can use ES6 there too.\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/04-ES6-Arrow2.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/04-ES6-Arrow2.html","title":"Arrows, Continued","keywords":"","body":"Implicit return\nContinuing a thought, the last thing we noted is that if the function does nothing except a return, we can simplify it even further:\nconst addTwo = num => num + 2;\n\n\nWe dropped the brackets and return keyword.\n\nIf there is no block following the arguments of an arrow function (meaning nothing in { } brackets), whatever follows is the return value of the function. The addTwo example above simply returns the value of num + 2. This is called an implicit return.\nSo we can write the arrow function for anything -\nconst addTwo = num => {\n  return num + 2;\n}\n\nas well as\nconst mutateNumbers = num => {\n  newNum = 6;\n  alert(newNum);\n  return num + newNum;\n}\n\nBut we can only use implicit return for the first function, addTwo. Because mutateNumbers has more than just a return statement in it, we still need the brackets.\nSo addTwo can be simplified to one line, but mutateNumbers cannot be.\nconst addTwo = num => num + 2;\n\nUsing implicit returns can shorten our syntax and make it more readable. The following function lowercaseListOfWords takes one argument, an array of strings, and returns a new array of lowercase strings.\nWritten with functions, this would look something like:\nfunction lowercaseListOfWords(arrayToModify) {\n  return arrayToModify.map(function(word) {\n    return word.toLocaleLowerCase();\n  });\n}\n\nHowever, using ES6, the arrow function, and implicit returns, we can make that one (albeit long!) line:\nconst lowercaseListOfWords = arrayToModify => arrayToModify.map(word => word.toLocaleLowerCase());\n\nImportantly, one gotcha to be aware of with implicit returns is that object literals must be wrapped in parentheses, so the interpreter (browser, compiler, etc.) can distinguish them from blocks. An example:\nconst isItActive = isActive => ({ active: isActive });\n\n\nEven though this function only returns one thing, because this function implicitly returns an object literal, it must be wrapped in parentheses.\n\nPlay around with implicit returns from arrow functions in this CodePen.\nThis binding - and the lack thereof\nSo - now that we've learned all the fun syntactic sugar of the arrow function, let's talk about the benefit of using it in execution context.\nIn non-arrow functions, every function defines its own this. There are tons of hacks to preserve the context, like var that = this and using .bind(this). This might look familiar:\nfunction eatBreakfast(pancakes) {\n  var that = this;\n  that.food = 'Knife please?';\n  Waiter\n  .bringCutlery(function (silverware) {\n    that.food = silverware;\n  });\n}\n\nAnother popular variant is var self = this. However you like to do it, you don't need to do it anymore!\nArrow functions don't change the definition of this. So, if this is already defined in the scope, and you call an arrow function, you can access this directly.\nThe equivalent arrow function:\nconst eatBreakfast = pancakes => {\n  this.food = 'Knife please?';\n  Waiter\n  .bringCutlery((silverware) => this.food = silverware);\n}\n\n\nCheck it out - the arrow function can be anywhere you declare a function!\n\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/05-ES6-Literals.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/05-ES6-Literals.html","title":"Literals","keywords":"","body":"This is the last bit of ES6 we'll check out before doing an exercise!\nObject literal shorthand\nObject literal shorthand is a simple but useful bit of syntactic sugar. If you want to assign a variable as the value of the key of the same name, you don't have to write it twice. What?\nOkay, what if we declare a variable, price, and set it equal to 100 (it's certainly something nice!): const price = 100;\nWe then have an object called item. Now, item also has a variable of how much that item costs, which happens to also be price. They are different variables (one is global, and the other is specific to the item object); they just happen to share the same name. So our item object might be:\nconst item = {\n  price: 15,\n};\n\nNow, let's say that when we initialize item, instead of hard coding a number into the initialization, we want to set price to be whatever the global price is. This global price is also stored in a variable called price, right?\nIt looks like this:\nconst price = 100;\n\nconst item = {\n  price: price,\n};\n\nIt's weird looking, but it works.\nWell, it turns out that having two different variables with the same name and setting them equal to each other is a pretty common thing to do. ES6 decided to just simplify this by dropping the duplicate and having it mean the same thing. So now we can do:\nconst price = 100;\n\nconst item = {\n  price,\n};\n\nLess to write, and less to read when you come back to it. A win-win!\nTemplate literals\nTemplate literals bring us string interpolation in JavaScript. This means we can create dynamic strings with more readable syntax.\nBefore ES6, we had:\nconst name = 'Mike';\nconst greeting = 'Hi, ' + name + '.';\n\nNow, using template literals, we can make this easier:\nconst name = 'Mike';\nconst greeting = `Hi, ${name}.`;\n\n\nNote that now, we can directly refer to the variable using ${} syntax within our string.\n\nIn fact, combining an arrow function with a template literal, we can do this:\nconst greeting = name => `Hi, ${name}.`;\n\nCheck it out in CodePen!\nLastly! Imports and modules\nIn ES6, you can import modules directly without declaring them as global variables. This makes namespacing your app a non-issue. Before module imports, namespace was often a primary concern in JavaScript.\nSo, if you want export my addTwo function as a module, you can create a file called \"addTwo.js\":\nconst addTwo = num => num + 2;\n\nexport default addTwo;\n\nAnd in another file, say \"app.js\", i can import it:\nimport addTwo from './addTwo'; //\n\naddTwo(3);\n\nYou can also export multiple modules from a file, like so:\nexport const addTwo = num => num + 2;\n\nexport const addThree = num => num + 3;\n\nAnd somewhere else:\nimport { addTwo, addThree } from './arithmetic';\n\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/06-ES6-Exercise.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/06-ES6-Exercise.html","title":"ES6 Exercise","keywords":"","body":"Exercise!\nWe've just learned a bunch of ES6.\nWe've learned:\n\n\n`const` and `let` instead of `var`\nRemember, When declaring variables using ES6 syntax, if you need to declare a variable whose value will _not_ change, declare it as a `const`.

React class components give you poperties that you don't always need, namely state, methods like setState, lifecycle methods like componentDidMount and componentWillReceiveProps, refs and more.\nSome components are purely presentational. They take props and render UI. As a React class, these components usually just contain a render method. Rather than create them as classes, you can write them as functions. A React Functional Component takes the props object as its argument, and returns JSX. Here's a very simple example. As a class, we might have:\nclass Name extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Name: {this.props.firstName} {this.props.lastName}\n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nBut with ES6, we now have:\nconst Name = props => (\n  \n    Name: {props.firstName} {props.lastName}\n  \n);\n\n\nThe whole declaration of class, extends, React.component, etc - it's all been replaced. We now just have the component name, an input for the props, and what is returned. Simplicity at its finest!\n\nFunctional components don't have to be \"simple\" - they can contain all kinds of logic. They're just JavaScript functions - so they can be as simple or complex as we make them. Let's make a more complicated example. What if we wanted a table of fruits?\nFruitTable will render a table that looks something like this:\n\nThis component written as a class, as we're used to, would look like this:\nclass FruitTable extends React.Component {\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          {this.props.data.map((fruitList, index) => (\n            \n              {fruitList.map((fruit, i) => (\n                \n                  {fruit}\n                \n              ))}\n            \n          ))}\n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n\n}\n\nThe thing is, using a class here doesn't give you any benefits over a Functional component. The class literally only has a render and a return, so all it really does is requires you to write a few more lines of code.\n\nA quick note on the keys in this example - When you render an array of items in React, you need to give each member of the array a unique key.

Rather than telling the DOM how to render the UI we want - which nodes to change, and how - we can use JSX to \"declare\" how we want the markup to look, and React alters the DOM accordingly. A Stateless Function literally makes your UI a function of the props you pass it, which is a declarative, functional approach to creating views.\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/08-Functional-Component-Exercise.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/08-Functional-Component-Exercise.html","title":"Functional Components Exercise","keywords":"","body":"Exercise!\nNow that we've learned about functional components, is there any place we can apply them?\nLook through the projects you've done so far. Are there any places you could use a functional component?\nLet's do one together. Open your todo list project.\nLook at your ListItem.js. All it does is return JSX.

Let's get technical!\nReact class components provide several lifecycle methods that you can use to control your application based on the state of the UI.\nThese methods happen automatically - but you can call them to modify them.\nThese methods are called at specific points in the rendering process. You can use these methods to perform actions based on what's happening on the DOM.\n\ncomponentDidMount, for example, is called immediately after a component is rendered to the DOM.\ncomponentWillUnmount is called immediately before a component is removed from the DOM.\n\nSome common uses of lifecycle methods are making asynchronous requests, binding event listeners, and optimizing for performance.\nComponent lifecycle methods:\n\nconstructor()\ncomponentWillMount()\ncomponentDidMount()\ncomponentWillUnmount()\ncomponentWillReceiveProps()\nrender()\nshouldComponentUpdate()\ncomponentWillUpdate()\ncomponentDidUpdate()\n\nLet's go through them. Again, you don't need to write these - only if you want to change something in them.\nHere they are in a diagram -  Open this image in a new window next to this one, and follow along as we go through the methods.\nconstructor()\nThis is something we've already seen when we were learning state. Like any JavaScript class, the constructor method is called when a component is instantiated (when it's first rendered).In a class constructor, you must call super before you do anything else. So a React component constructor in its most basic form looks like this:\nconstructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n}\n\nYou don't need to define a constructor if that's all it does, though. This happens automatically when your component is invoked. A common use of the constructor is to initialize state using the props passed to the component - as we have been doing!\nconstructor(props) {\n  super(props);\n  this.state = {\n    fruits: props.fruits,\n  };\n}\n\n\nThis constructor sets the initial fruits state of the component to the fruits prop passed to the component. Then, using setState, your user can add fruits, delete them, or whatever else your component allows.\n\nAnother common use of the constructor method is to bind class methods.\nWhen a method is \"bound\" to a component, it means that when the method is invoked, this will refer to the component, and not to the context that invoked the method. So, if you pass a component's method to a child component from a parent component, you can be sure that this.setState will set the state of the parent component if the method is bound to it.\nIn JavaScript classes, methods aren't bound by default. So, if you pass a component's method to a child component without binding it, it can lose its context, and not behave the way you intended. Here's an example:\nclass FruitTable extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      fruits: props.fruits,\n    };\n    this.addFruit = this.addFruit.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  addFruit(fruit) {\n    this.setState(prevState => ({\n      fruits: prevState.fruits.concat(fruit),\n    }));\n  }\n\n}\n\nNotice that in the constructor, this.addFruit is bound to the class - this.addFruit = this.addFruit.bind(this);\nNow, if I pass this.addFruit to a child component as an onChange callback, it will be bound to FruitTable and will update its state when it's invoked.\nAgain, you don't need a constructor in every React component, but if you need to initialize state by props or bind methods, the constructor is where you do it.\ncomponentWillMount()\nThis method is called immediately before a component is rendered to the DOM. You generally won't need to use this method. Advanced use-cases like server-rendering are usually the only ones in which componentWillMount is needed.\ncomponentDidMount() and componentWillUnmount()\nThe componentDidMount method is called once, immediately after your component is rendered to the DOM. If you want to make an AJAX request when your component first renders, this is where to do it (not in the constructor, or in componentWillMount). componentWillMount shouldn't be used for server requests because it may be invoked multiple times before render in future versions of React. Side effects should be avoided in the constructor, and so server requests shouldn't be made there. The accepted answer on this Stack Overflow from a member of the React team at Facebook gives more detail. In the following example, I fetch data from the server, then set the state of the component using the response.\ncomponentDidMount() {\n  fetch(`http://api.com/${this.props.id}`)\n    .then(response => response.json())\n    .then(data => this.setState(prevState => ({ data })));\n}\n\nAnother common use for componentDidMount is to bind event listeners to your component. You can then remove the event listeners in componentWillUnmount. In this example, I bind and unbind an event listener for a drag-drop component.\nclass FruitTable extends React.component {\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    document.addEventListener('dragover', this.handleDragStart);\n  }\n\n  componentWillUnmount() {\n    document.removeEventListener('dragover', this.handleDragStart);\n  }\n\n  handleDragStart(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    this.setState(prevState => ({\n      dragging: true\n    }));\n  }\n\n}\n\nrender()\nThis is the one method that every React class component must have. In render, you return JSX using the compoment's props and state. You should never set state in render - render should only react to changes in state or props, not create those changes. The following component renders a single prop and a single state key - a car model and a speed. Once this component is mounted, its speed state will go up by 1 every second. You can try it out yourself on CodePen.\nclass Car extends React.Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      speed: props.speed || 0,\n    }\n    this.incrementSpeed = this.incrementSpeed.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    window.setTimeout(this.incrementSpeed, 1000);\n  }\n\n  incrementSpeed() {\n    this.setState(prevState => ({ speed: prevState.speed + 1 }));\n    window.setTimeout(this.incrementSpeed, 1000);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        This {this.props.model} is going {this.state.speed} miles per hour!\n      \n    );\n  }\n\n}\n\nTo break down what's happening in this component:\nconstructor\nThe initial state is set to either the speed prop, or 0 if the speed prop is not passed to the component.  \nI bind this.incrementSpeed to the class, so that when it's used as a callback for setTimeout, this refers to the Car class.\ncomponentDidMount\nI tell window.setTimeout to call this.incrememntSpeed after one second (1000 ms).\nincrementSpeed\nthis.setState(prevState => ({ speed: prevState.speed + 1 }));: The speed state is set to one higher than it was previously - I add one.\nwindow.setTimeout(this.incrementSpeed, 1000): The incrementSpeed method is recursive) - it invokes itself as the timeout callback. After one second, window.setTimeout will call this.incrementSpeed again - the speed will go up by one, and a new timer will be set to do it again.\ncomponentWillReceiveProps(newProps)\nThis method is called any time your component receives new props. It is not called with the initial props when your component initially mounts. If you need to change the state of your component based on changes in the props, this is where you do it. In a simple app, you generally won't need componentWillReceiveProps.\nshouldComponentUpdate, componentWillUpdate, componentDidUpdate\nThese methods are called when a component's props or state change, and are generally used for performance optimizations. React is quite fast by itself, and you usually don't need to concern yourself with these methods outside of a large app with many dynamic components.\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/10-Unidirectional-Data-Flow.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/10-Unidirectional-Data-Flow.html","title":"Unidirectional Flow","keywords":"","body":"Unidirectional Data Flow\nUNIDIRECTIONAL FLOW VIDEO\nIn React applications, data usually flows from the top down.\nWhen several components in a view need to share state, you lift, or \"hoist\", the state so that it's available to all the components that need it. Let's look at a search filter as an example. This app will have two basic components - one that displays a list of data, and one that captures user input to filter the data.\nI do: Build a fruit filter\nOur data will be simple - a list of fruits. The app will end up looking something like this:\n\nWhen building a React app, it's important to take time to define the app's structure before you start writing code. I'm going to define the components and the state I need before I write the code.\nComponents\nThis app needs two components:\n\nA list component to display the list of fruit. This component needs one piece of data: the array of fruits to display.\nAn input to capture the filter value from the user. This component needs one piece of data: the current value of the filter.\n\nState\nThis app needs to keep track of changes in two items:\n\nThe filtered list of fruits\nThe value of the filter\n\nComponent hierarchy\nI have two sibling components (components at the same level of the tree/app) that need to be aware of each other's data. Specifically, the list component needs to only show the fruits that match the filter value. So I need to get data from one sibling to another. Something like this:\n\nHow to achieve this, though? Using unidrectional data flow, of course! If I create a container component to hold both the filter value and the filtered list, I can hoist the state to the container so it's available to all the children. It will then be trivial to display it in the child components. The data will flow like this:\n\nChild components\nNow that I know the components I need, the state I need, and where everything needs to be, I can start writing some code. First, I'll create the child components. I can use Functional components, since they won't need to hold their own state.\nconst FruitList = props => (\n  \n     {props.fruits.map(fruit => {fruit})}\n  \n);\n\nconst FruitFilter = props => (\n  \n    Filter these Fruits: \n    \n   \n);\n\nFruitList renders an unordered list (ul) which contains an array of li elements, each with a single fruit string. FruitList uses array map to convert the array of fruit strings in our data to an array of fruit li elements to render. Using map to convert data arrays to arrays of UI elements is a common pattern you will use, and see used, in React.\nFruitFilter renders a single input. Its value and onChange callbacks will both be set by the container component.\nConatiner component\nMy container will be a class with a few methods I'll use to initialize and update the state of the two child components.\nIn the constructor, I'll initialize the state:\nconstructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      // initialize the fruit list to the full list passed in props\n      fruitsToDisplay: props.fruits,\n      // intialize the filter value to an empty string\n      filterValue: '',\n    };\n  }\n\nI'll need a method to update the state when the filter value changes. This method will store the filter state, and filter the list of fruits to display. I'll pass this change handler to the filter component to react to user input.\nhandleFilterChange(event) {\n  event.preventDefault();\n  const filterValue = event.target.value;\n  this.setState((prevState, props) => {\n    // remove fruits that don't contain the filter value\n    const filteredFruitList = props.fruits.filter(fruit =>\n      fruit.toLocaleLowerCase().includes(filterValue.toLocaleLowerCase()));\n    // return new state with the filtered fruit list and the new value of the filter\n    return {\n      fruitsToDisplay: filteredFruitList,\n      filterValue,\n    };\n  })\n}\n\nFinally, I need to render my child components.\nrender() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n\nThe full container component looks like this:\nclass FruitContainer extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = {\n      // initialize the fruit list to the full list passed in props\n      fruitsToDisplay: props.fruits,\n      // intialize the filter value to an empty string\n      filterValue: '',\n    };\n    // bind the context of our filterChange event handler\n    this.handleFilterChange = this.handleFilterChange.bind(this);\n  }\n\n  handleFilterChange(event) {\n    event.preventDefault();\n    const filterValue = event.target.value;\n    this.setState((prevState, props) => {\n      // remove fruits that don't contain the filter value\n      const filteredFruitList = props.fruits.filter(fruit =>\n        fruit.toLocaleLowerCase().includes(filterValue.toLocaleLowerCase()));\n      // return new state with the filtered fruit list and the new value of the filter\n      return {\n        fruitsToDisplay: filteredFruitList,\n        filterValue,\n      };\n    })\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n\n}\n\nAll of the data is hoisted to the top of the tree in the container, and I pass it to the child components.\nYou do: Also display the fruits that do not match the filter\nOnce you have your data structured well, it's easier to add features to your applications or make changes to them. Because all of our data lives at the top of the tree, we can send it where we want. The full code for the fruit filter is available at this CodePen. Fork the CodePen and add a feature. Add another child component to the FruitContainer that displays the fruits that do not match the filter value (this should be all the items that are not in the fruitsToDisplay list).\nFinally\nIt's important that you think through your applications before you start writing code. It's often helpful to sketch out your app, and identify the components you need, the state you need, and where that state needs to live. Use the unidirectional data flow pattern - hoist your state toward the top of the component tree so it's available to the children that need it.\n"},"lectures/02-further-react-info/11-Immutable-Data.html":{"url":"lectures/02-further-react-info/11-Immutable-Data.html","title":"Immutable Data","keywords":"","body":"Immutable Data Types\nSomething that is immutable is something that cannot be changed. In JavaScript, objects and arrays are mutable - they can be changed. A simple example of object mutation (note that I declare the object as a const, but it is still mutated):\nconst anObject = {\n  foo: 'bar',\n};\n\nanObject.foo = 'barrrrrrr';\n\nI just changed anObject's value - I mutated it. This happens because JavaScript assigns objects and arrays to variables by reference. Changing their properties does not change their reference, and so they are mutated.\nHere's an example of mutating an array: \nconst anArray = ['oneFish', 'two fish', 'red fish', 'blue fish'];\nanArray.pop(); // new value of anArray is ['oneFish', 'two fish', 'red fish']\n\nIn React, components' state and props are to be treated as immutable. But wait, we have to change the state, right? Yes, yes we do. Just never do it by mutating the state directly. \nDon't do:\nhandleChange(event) {\n  this.state.myPieceOfState = event.target.value;\n}\n\nThis method directly mutates the component's state. When state is updated, we want our components to re-render with the new data. When state is mutated, React may not be aware of the change, and re-render may not happen.\nThe good news is that you already know how to avoid this. React makes it easy: components have a setState method that allows us to update the state without mutating it. Behind the scenes, React is returning a fresh copy of the state (with a new reference) with the updated data when you use setState.\nDo:\nhandleChange(event) {\n  this.setState(prevState => ({\n    myPieceOfState: event.target.value,\n  }));\n}\n\nComponent props should not be changed within a component at all. There is no setProps method. Props change above the component in the tree and are passed down. Refer to the unidirectional data flow lesson for more on this.\nImmutability everywhere\nTreating data as immutable makes application development easier. Data mutations can be hard to track (say, in a debugger). Though vanilla JavaScript does not have immutable object and array types, you can still develop JavaScript applications that treat data as immutable.\nImmutable methods\nAs mentioned above, array.pop() mutates the array. You can achieve the same effect without mutating the array, however.\nThe array methods map, filter, and reduce return modified copies of the array and don't mutate the originals. To pop an array without mutating it, you could:\nconst newArray = anArray.filter((item, index, originalArray) => index !== originalArray.length -1);\n\nSimiliarly, there are ways to change data in objects that don't mutate the originals. ES6 Object.assign is great for this.\nconst newObject = Object.assign({}, anObject, { foo: 'barrrrr' });\n\nNotice that the first argument to Object.assign is an empty object literal - this means that the keys from anObject and the third argument will be copied to a brand new object (with a new reference), which will be returned as the value of newObject.\nImmutable libraries\nWhile it's certainly possible to write vanilla JavaScript applications and maintain immutable data types, it can get tedious, and if you're not careful you can accidentally mutate your data. There are several mature JavaScript libraries that provide immutable data types and/or immutable methods that can make maintaing immutable data types trivial. One of the most popular is Immutable.js from Facebook, which provides immutable data types like List, Stack, Map, OrderedMap, Set, OrderedSet and Record - and methods for making changes to your data like set, get, delete, update, etc. With a library like Immutable.js you don't have to think about immutability - just use the types and methods provided, and the library takes care of it for you.\nAdditional Resources:\n\nJavaScript immutable libraries\n\n"},"lectures/03-router/00-router-introduction.html":{"url":"lectures/03-router/00-router-introduction.html","title":"React Router","keywords":"","body":"Browser History Mechanics\nWe're going to look at old, traditional browser history mechanics (like back\nand forward) and see how they're built for an old internet where people\nbrowsed between lots of different pages.

The\nbrowser is still visiting different pages they're just on different sites.\nIt's important to specifically note what a \"page\" is. A page is a whole HTML\nfile that your browser downloads and displays. You know you're navigating\nbetween two different pages when you see your browser screen go blank, then\nslowly load in a totally new page.\nWe're going into detail about what a page is in order to draw contrast to how\nmodern web applications don't use multiple pages like they used to. Modern web\napplications are now often what we call Single Page Applications.\nBefore we get into Single Page Applications, let's talk about URL routing.\nWhat is URL Routing?\nRouting defines what content is displayed when someone visits a certain a\nURL. If I go to http://github.com/ I would expect to see GitHub's homepage.\nIf I got to http://github.com/login I would expect to see a login page. Each\nof these URLs is a route. A route pairs a URL with the content that should\nbe displayed for that URL. You should be able to visit a webpage, copy the URL\nto a friend, and they should end up viewing the same page.\nLet's look at an example of how content is routed by URLs by looking at the\nGeneral Assembly homepage.\nGo to https://generalassemb.ly/. Interact with the menu in the top bar on\nthe right. You should see options for things like \"On Campus,\" \"Locations,\" and\n\"About.\" Click on the different links to pages and notice the URLs that you end\nup at. Hover over the links to see their URL to save yourself from actually\nnavigating off the page.\nThis table shows the path for each URL. The path of a URL is everything\nafter the domain name. In this case the path is everything that appears\nafter \"https://generalassemb.ly\" in the location bar of the browser. The /\npath is a special path called the root. It's the homepage.\nCompare the paths in the URLs and get a sense for how URLs are routed to\ncontent. Websites URLs are general split into succinct, descriptive,\nhierarchical categories. Notice how going to /locations takes you to a page\nshowing all campus locations, then each specific location is in a hierarchy\nunder that, like /locations/london and /locations/singapore.\n\n\n\nURL Route\nContent\n\n\n\n\n/\nHomepage\n\n\n/about\nGeneral Information\n\n\n/education\nShows all local upcoming courses\n\n\n/education/web-development-immersive\nWDI course details\n\n\n/education/user-experience-design-immersive\nUX course details\n\n\n/locations\nShows all global GA locations\n\n\n/locations/london\nShows London-specific location information\n\n\n/locations/singapore\nShows London-specific location information\n\n\n\nYou can see that URLs route users to content. When someone types in a URL\nthey are ultimately shown content associated with that URL.\nHave you ever tried to send someone a link to what you're looking at on Google\nMaps and then when they click on your link they end up looking at something\ncompletely different? That's a great example of bad URL routing. (Google Maps\nis actually much better about this these days.) URLs should represent the\nmain content of the page you're looking at!\nOld web sites that spread their content across multiple pages use URLs to route\nusers to different pages. Websites can also use different URLs with hashtags to go to different content on the same page...\nFor example - Open a new tab in your browser and navigate back to that Wikipedia article for\nCafe Allegro in Seattle.\n\nHover over the \"1. History\" link in the Contents section\n\nLook in the lower left of your browser to see the URL the link leads to\nNotice the URL looks like wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafe_Allegro#history,\nspecifically note the hashtag #history\nClick the history link and notice how it scrolls you down in the same page. This still counts as a route - it's navigating you to a section on the page.\n\nModern Single Page Applications\nNow, consider webpages where depending on what you click on, the actual content of the page dynamically changes. Modern web apps serve just one\npage and they change parts of the contents of the page, without\nhaving to reload the entire page or send users to another page.\nWebsites that serve up only one page and change the content of the page\ndynamically without reload the page are called Single Page Applications.\nOpen your browser and navigate to Gmail (or whichever email site you use):\n\nWhen you load Gmail, you see your inbox\nYou can start instant messaging a friend in a sidebar\nYou can start to compose a new email to your manager to request time off\nYou can search for an email with flight information\nYou can browse through more email to make sure you've talked your manager\nabout getting time off and aren't just disappearing for a week\n\nThis all happens on one page! The page never refreshes. The chat bar with your\nfriend never disappears as you compose an email and search through your inbox.\nGmail fits the definition of a Single Page Application. Gmail loads one\npage just once and that page replaces content dynamically to show you many\ndifferent things. That single page changes its content dynamically without\nreloading or sending you to another page. It's great!\nConsider the benefits of a single page application:\n\nIt's fast.

Since single page apps only change the content\nof themselves without actually sending users to different web pages the notion\nof back and forward is lost.\nWhen users press the back button in a Single Page Application they go back\noff the one page, completely out of the Single Page Application.\nImagine being on Wikipedia, going to Gmail, going through several views of\ndifferent email inboxes, search results and then pressing the back button.\n\nGo to wikipedia.org\nType in www.gmail.com (or whichever) to check your email\nClick on one email\nSearch your email for something\nOpen that email\nClick 'back' in your browser to go back to the search results\nWait - you end up back at wikipedia.org\n\nGmail and most mail apps are a Single Page Applications - despite the content changing, you are always on gmail.com. Because of this, pressing the back button will take back to the previous URL they were on - in this case, Wikipedia - when really, the user just wanted to go back\nto their email search results.\nIntroducing Modern Browser History Mechanics\nSo - developers need to have their fast loading web applications, but somehow still have the 'back' button work.\nWeb Developers, browser vendors, and users (even if they don't know it) all love Single Page Applications; they're a great experience that the community is embracing. To facilitate these and still have things like the 'back' button work, a few years ago, people got together in committees and devised a way to upgrade the old\nbrowser history mechanics to accommodate modern SPAs.\nThe modern HTML5 specification (published October 2014) introduced new browser\nhistory mechanics to make Single Page Applications easier to browse 'back' and\n'forward', even through they actually stay on the same page.\n How? \nHTML5 introduced .pushState and .replaceState functions that allow web pages\nto save custom history data to the browser. Applications like Gmail can use\nthese functions to manually save custom browser history. For example, Gmail can use .pushState to put in the browser history that a user is on their search results page, so if they go into an email and click 'back', they get back to the search page - instead of off gmail.com completely.\nA bit more technically, when someone goes from\ntheir inbox to a specific email, Gmail can use .pushState to save in the browser information\nabout what the user is currently doing in the application. Now when the user\npresses the 'back' button, the browser gives the saved information back to\nGmail and Gmail brings back the content the user was last looking at.\nRecap\nHere's a summary of what we've learned today:\nSingle Page Applications and Browser History Mechanics\n\nSingle Page Applications are websites that serve only one web page, then\nchange the content of that page dynamically, without refreshing.\nOld browser history mechanics support back and forward operations that\ntraditionally keep track of history as users move between different pages.\nSince modern Single Page Applications keep the user on one page without\nrefreshing old browser history back and forward mechanics don't work\nwell with modern applications - so HTML5 changed the rules of how 'back' and 'forward' can work.\n\n"},"lectures/03-router/03-react-router-intro.html":{"url":"lectures/03-router/03-react-router-intro.html","title":"React Router Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Intro to React Router\nObjectives\n\nReview how websites use URLs to route content\nReview what it means for a website to be a Single Page Application\nIntroduce React Routers main features: routing, components, history\nUse React Router to map URLs to components\nUse React Router to create links to different pages\n\nIt's great that HTML5 introduced new browser history mechanics to make it easier\nfor us developers to build Single Page Applications, and it's great for us to know about. However, on a great note - we're actually not going to\nbe using these new features directly ourselves! Instead, we'll use a tool called\nReact Router that bundles many concepts together and allows us to create our\nown Single Page Applications extremely easily. Even though we won't use the\nnew history mechanics firsthand ourselves, it's still important to know that our\nframework is taking care of that for us under the hood.\nFor an intro to our next topic, watch this video.\n\n\nReact Router is a third-party library that makes it easy for us to route\nspecific URLs to specific content on our page. In our React app different\ncontent will be grouped up in its own regular React component. Once we\ndefine how the URLs are routed to the components, React Router will\nmanage our Single Page App's browser history automatically.\nHere's what React Router provides:\n\nRouting: easily define what content is associated with what URLs.\nHistory: automatically manage browser history when navigating between\ncontent.\n\nReact Router is actually a third-party library. Third Party just means it's\nnot built by React and it's not built by ourselves. It's been written by some\nother \"third-party\" group of developers. Even though React Router is third-party\nsoftware, it's extremely useful, trustworthy, and popular - don't be afraid to use it.\n"},"lectures/03-router/04-dentist-exercise.html":{"url":"lectures/03-router/04-dentist-exercise.html","title":"React Router - Codealong Setup","keywords":"","body":"The Plan: Our Example Dentist Website\nWe'll make an example Dentist website that has a Home page, a page that lists\navailable Procedures and a page displaying Contact information.

Saving the library as a dependency\nmakes it easy for us to copy our project to another machine and just run\nnpm install to install all of the dependencies for our project.\nreact-router-dom is the official name of React Router\n\nSo, in summary, we're telling npm install to find the library package called\nreact-router-dom, install the package, and save the name of our package to our\nfile that keeps track of all the packages for our project.\nIf you don't use the --save flag then npm install will still find the\npackage and download it. It just won't save the package to your package.json\nfile so you can easily install all your saved dependencies later on if you move\nto another machine.\nIn Your Terminal\nNow let's make the dentist project. In your terminal, type:\n$ create-react-app dentist-website\n$ cd dentist-website\n$ npm install --save react-router-dom\n$ npm start\nYour browser should open to http://localhost:3000/ and you'll see the standard\n\"Welcome to React\" message with a fancy rotating atomic icon. create-react-app\ncreates several files for us in a directory called src. Open the App.js\nfile in your editor.\nApp.js contains our main application. You should see the basic HTML structure\nof the standard React starter page. Make sure the file is the same thing you're\nlooking at in the browser by finding the text Welcome to React inside an\n element.\nChange the text to say My First React Router App, save the file and make sure\nyou see the changes automatically appear in your browser.\n\nIf it doesn't automatically refresh, then try to manually\n  refresh the page. If you still don't see changes after a manual refresh then  something could be wrong. Make sure you're editing the right file.\n\n  \n    **Pro tip:**\n\n    It's a good idea to make simple, verifiable changes like this when\n    you're first starting to make changes to a project. It's like a sanity check.\n    Make sure you can do simple things first. Don't start with complex things; many things can go wrong when you make complex changes. Prove to yourself the small changes work, and you'll save yourself headaches debugging large\n    complex changes.\n  \n\nCreate Custom Homepage\nLet's get rid of the standard \"Welcome to React\" page and replace it with our\nown Dentist Website Homepage. Continue editing App.js. Gut most of the HTML\ncontents, and delete the import statement for the logo.svg which we won't use.\nThe App.js file contains one component that our whole App will live inside\nof. Remember that React components have a render(){ ... } function that\ndefines what the component will look like when it is rendered on the webpage.\n\n  **Repetition for good practice reminder:**\n\n  The render function alway has to return *at most* one top-level element. It's\n  common to wrap everything in your component in a `` to make sure you\n  satisfy this constraint.\n\n\n\nSo...\nI added one  that says Dentist Website and added a paragraph with some\nshort welcome text. My App.js file now looks like this. Save the file and go\nto your browser to make sure these changes show up.\nApp.js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Dentist Website\n        \n          Welcome to my dentist website.\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nGood.

Now you have your Home component.\nGo back to the App.js file and delete the  and  tags where we used to\nhave content written directly inside our App component. We don't\nneed that written inside App any longer, because we just moved it all to the\nnew Home component.\nInstead, we need to call our new component. Put  inside the  in the App component.

You'll see an\nerror, which should look like this:\n\n\nIt's not enough to simply create the Home.js file and create the Home\ncomponent. We must also remember to import the component into the App.js file. Any components you want to use in a file need to first be imported into that file.\nYour App.js and Home.js files should look like this after you've properly\ncreated and imported the Home component.\nApp.js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\nimport Home from './Home';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\nexport default App;\n\nHome.js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nclass Home extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        Dentist Website\n        \n          Welcome to my dentist website.\n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Home;\n\nCreate Components for Procedures and Contact\nThe purpose of our site is to create several components that we can swap out\nas the main content of the main page of our application in order to create a\nmodern Single Page Application. We'll create two more components, and then\nwe'll start routing things up.\n\nCreate a new file called Procedures.js\nCreate a new file called Contact.js\n\nThe files\nwere created using the same procedure we used to create the Home component\nusing the App component as a template. Basically: create each file, change the\nname of the component to its new name, then replace the HTML in the\nrender() { ... } function with custom content. Be sure to import each new\ncomponent into App.js just like we did with the Home component.\nYou can put your own content to be rendered by each component if you'd like.

You should see all of content for each of the pages all stacked on top of each\nother on the homepage. If you don't see content from all three of your\ncomponents then something is wrong.

You should see your webpage update with just that\ncomponent. This is effectively what React Router does. We can configure React Router\nso that it's aware of which component we want to show on the screen, and React\nRouter will swap the components out so that only the correct one is shown at a time.\nNow that we've proven to ourselves that we're able to show each of the\ncomponents on the main page, it's time to hook them up to Router.\nCreating Routes\nHere's the general syntax for creating routes. React Router uses some of its own components to define how URLs are routed\nto your components and to create links to those routes. You must have one \ncomponent that wraps itself around multiple  components. Each \ncomponent has two pieces:\n\npath - defining the URL path that leads to the component.\ncomponent - defining\nwhat component users will see when they navigate to the path.\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\n\nThere are three other important things to note here:\n\nThis goes in place of your existing component calls of  or  (depending on which syntax you went for).\n\nThe first route for the homepage at the root URL path / uses a\nspecial extra exact attribute before defining the path. The exact attribute\nmeans the component associated with the route will only be shown if users are\nat exactly that URL path. If you forget to include the exact keyword then\nwhen someone navigates to /courses they will actually see two components,\nbecause / is a partial match for /courses.\n\nNotice that all of the  components are wrapped inside one . Like render, the\n element requires that it only has one direct child element. If you don't\nwrap the routes with a , the page will appear blank, and you'll have to\nopen your JavaScript console to see that there's an error being logged to the\nconsole. Like so -\n\n\n\nPro tip: It's a good habit to check the console for errors whenever your\napp is not behaving as expected.\nImport Statements\nIn order to use the React Router components, you'll need to import them. This\nimport syntax allows us to grab several specific components out of the\nreact-router-dom library at once. So far we've used Router and Route.\nThe Router component is actually called BrowserRouter\ninside the library package, but we'll use the as keyword to rename it to\nRouter so it's easier to remember.\nWhile we're here, we'll also import a third component, Link, which we'll get to in a minute.\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Route,\n  Link\n} from 'react-router-dom';\nFully Routed\nHere's how the imports and all the components look like together for our dentist\nwebsite:\nApp.js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nimport {\n  BrowserRouter as Router,\n  Route,\n  Link\n} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nimport Home from './Home';\nimport Procedures from './Procedures';\nimport Contact from './Contact';\n\n\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n          \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\nNavigate to the Routes\nNow that everything is hooked up you can manually enter different URLs and\nsee how your page appears. If you go to http://localhost:3000/, you should\nsee just the homepage. If you go to http://localhost:3000/procedures, you should\nsee just the procedures page. If you go to http://localhost:3000/contact,\nthen you should see just the contact page.\n\nCheck it!\n\nMake sure that React Router is routing from each URL to the proper component\ncorrectly.\nDouble check to make sure that the home page doesn't display at the\nsame time as another component. If the homepage is shown while you're at the\npath to /procedures or /contact then you probably did not write the exact\nkeyword when you defined the / Home route.\n\n\nDebugging Common Errors\nLet's intentionally make an error. Delete the exact keyword off the Home\nroute. Navigate to the /procedures page and the /contact page again and\nsee how the components are displayed. You should see the content of the\nhomepage and the content for one of the other pages at the same time, with\nthe home page on top.\nNow add the exact keyword back to the home route and notice that the pages\ndon't double up any more.\nTwo common errors:\n\nIf the page appears blank, open the JavaScript console to see if there are\nerrors. Chances are you have a typo somewhere or forgot to make sure the\n only has one child element. Remember, wrap all of your  components\nin one .\nIf multiple components appear on the page at the same time there's\nsomething with how you've routed URLs. Make sure you use the exact\nkeyword on the root path / and make sure there are no duplicate URL paths\ndefined anywhere.\n\nAdding a Nav Section\nGreat, now our site is up and running! We can manually type in URLs and see the\ndifferent pages.\nAlthough... users never really type URLs, do they? We should probably have links at the top of the page so we can just click on\nthings. We could build this ourselves, but we don't have to! Remember that Link component we imported from React Router?\nJust like links in HTML, we can wrap  tags around whatever text that we want to display to the user to click on. The pieces of this are:\n\n - creates  tags and automatically integrates\nmodern HTML5 browser history mechanics for the Single Page Application. It\nhas one attribute:\nto - what path to navigate to when the user clicks the link\n\nWe'll add one \n  component that leads to each of our different content pages.\nGo to Home Page\nSee Our Procedures\nContact Us!\n\n\nDid you notice that we don't reference components here? We simply make links for users to click that connect to URLs, and the Router section in the code handles the actual component changes.\n\nWe can include those links in a  element at the top of our page.\nIt will stay on the page permanently, and the different components will be\nswapped between each other below it. There's actually nothing special about\nthe  element. It behaves exactly like a .  Is just a\nsemantic element that gives your HTML more meaning when people read it.\nSo, our web app now looks like the left image - but do you see a difference between the left and the right?\n\nThere's one slightly annoying thing about React here - React strips out whitespace between elements. If we write  components next to each\nother, even if they're on new lines, React strips all of the whitespace\n(spaces, returns, tabs...) between them and squishes them all together.\nWe\nmust insert a space manually by writing {' '} in order to get spaces between\nour links.\nSo instead, here's how we'll write the links. Nothing has changed except that we've added the space:\nGo to Home Page{' '}\nSee Our Procedures{' '}\nContact Us!\nAnd now the nav bar will have spaces like it should.\nFinal Code\nHere's what our final App.js looks like:\nclass App extends Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n            Go to Home Page{' '}\n            See Our Procedures{' '}\n            Contact Us!\n          \n          \n          \n          \n        \n      \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default App;\n\n\nCheck it out!

The DOM and jQuery are actually examples of APIs! Since the explosion of information technology, however, the term now commonly refers to web URLs that can be accessed for raw data.\nAPIs publish data for public use. As third-party software developers, we can access an organization's API and use their data within our own applications.\n\n  Q: Why do we care?\n\n  > Why recreate data when we don't have to? Think about past projects or ideas that would be easier if you could pull in data already gathered elsewhere.\n\n  > APIs can provide us with data that would we would otherwise not be able to create ourselves.\n\n\n\nAs we move into building single page applications, now is the perfect time to start understanding how to obtain data on the client side and then render it on the browser.\nAPI Exploration\nThere are a variety of APIs available on the internet. Here are just a few examples of APIs that you can use. Below are requests that you could make with the fetch() command (or any other form of XMLHttpRequest) and see value. Check them out.\n\n\n\nAPI\nSample URL\n\n\n\n\nThis for That\nhttp://itsthisforthat.com/api.php?json\n\n\nGiphy\nhttp://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC\n\n\nOMDB API\nhttp://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Game%20of%20Thrones&Season=1\n\n\nStarWars\nhttp://swapi.co/api/people/3\n\n\nStocks\nhttp://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/Quote/xml?symbol=AAPL\n\n\nPokemon\nhttp://pokeapi.co/api/pokemon/4\n\n\n\n\nDoes the JSON look unreadable in the browser? If you're using Chrome, install the JSON View plugin.\n\nWhy Just Data?\nSometimes thats's all we need. All this information, from all these browsers and all these servers, has to travel through the network. That's almost certainly the slowest part of the request cycle. We want to minimize the bits. There are times when we just need the data. For those times, we want a concise format.   \nAll data sent via HTTP are strings. Unfortunately, what we really want to pass between web applications is structured data (i.e., arrays and hashes). Thus, native data structures can be serialized into a string representation of the data. This string can be transmitted and then parsed back into data by another web agent.  \nThere are two major serialized data formats that you will typically encounter: JSON and XML.\nJSON\nJSON stands for \"JavaScript Object Notation\" and has become a universal standard for serializing native data structures for transmission. It is light-weight, easy to read and quick to parse.\n{\n  \"users\": [\n    {\"name\": \"Omily\", \"id\": 0},\n    {\"name\": \"Lichard\", \"id\": 1},\n    {\"name\": \"Kathew\", \"id\": 2}\n  ]\n}\n\n\nRemember, JSON is a serialized format. While it may look like an object, it needs to be parsed so we can interact with it as a true Javascript object.\n\nXML\nXML stands for \"eXtensible Markup Language\" and is the granddaddy of serialized data formats (itself based on HTML). XML is fat, ugly and cumbersome to parse. It remains a major format, however, due to its legacy usage across the web. You'll probably always favor using a JSON API, if available.\n\n  \n    \n  \n  \n    \n  \n\n\nMany APIs publish data in multiple formats, for example:\n\n\nhttp://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/Quote/json?symbol=AAPL\nhttp://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/Quote/xml?symbol=AAPL\n\nAPIs are published everywhere. Chances are good that most major content sources you follow online publish their data in some type of serialized format. Heck, even Marvel publishes an API. Look around for a \"Developers\" section on major websites. Or, if you'd like a cheat sheet you can try the Programmable Web API Directory or the Public APIs Directory.\nWhile the majority of APIs are free to use, many of them require an API \"key\" that identifies the developer requesting data access. This is done to regulate usage and prevent abuse. Some APIs also rate-limit developers, meaning they have caps on the free data allowed during a given time period.\n\nTry hitting the Giphy API...\n\n\nNo key: http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat\n\nWith key: http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC\n\n\n\nIt is very important that you not push your API keys to a public Github repo.**\nThis is especially true when working with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Here's an example of a stolen key horror story.\n\nIntroducing fetch()\nSo we know what an API is. Now what?\nHow can we use an API to dynamically manipulate the DOM with the given data? We can use fetch(). In then past, these have been called AJAX requests. As you'll come to learn, this allows us to build single page applications that do not require refreshes.\nAJAX, which stands for \"Asynchronous Javascript and XML,\" is the method through which we are able to make HTTP requests. The standard requests we will be making are GET POST PUT PATCH and DELETE.  \n\n\n\nType of Request\nWhat's It Do?\n\n\n\n\nGET\nRead\n\n\nPOST\nCreate\n\n\nPUT\nUpdate\n\n\nPATCH\nUpdate\n\n\nDELETE\nDelete\n\n\n\n\nEach request contains a message header and body. The browser packages this together using fetch() and sends it off to a server. The server then listens to your request and provides a response. It looks something like this:\n\nA detailed version of what a request would look like:\n\nWhen you browse to your favourite websites, your browser is making a request and the server provides a response. fetch() allows us to perform the same type of requests over a network. Imagine fetching weather information and rendering it on your website. Perhaps you want to create a real-life Pokedex? You can use fetch() to build these applications.\nTaking a look at fetch in action\nEnough talk - it is time to take a look at fetch() in action. Imagine we want to fetch() a randomly generated poem from Shakespeare. Good thing that there is an API for that, right? This API provides us with the ability get a poem using the following URL:\nhttp://ShakeItSpeare.com/api/poem\nWe're then provided a response that looks like the following:\n{\n    poem: \"Fear is the mind-killer.\n            Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.\n            I will face my fear.\n            I will permit it to pass over me and through me.\n            And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.\n            Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.\n            Only I will remain.\",\n    markov: 2,\n    lines: 7\n}\n\nOkay, so that isn't a poem that the API would provide but it is an example of the JSON that you will get from that endpoint.\nWe can fetch this JSON easily using Javascript. We have provided a legacy example as well as a modern ES6 example as well to compare.\nES5 Syntax\nvar poemApi = 'http://ShakeItSpeare.com/api/poem';\nfetch(poemApi)\n  .then(function(response) {\n    return response.json()\n  }).then(function(json) {\n    console.log('JSON from Shakeitspeare.com', json)\n  }).catch(function(ex) {\n    console.log('An error occured while parsing!', ex)\n  });\n\nES6 Syntax\nlet poemApi = 'http://ShakeItSpeare.com/api/poem';\nfetch(poemApi)\n  .then((response) => {\n    return response.json()\n  }).then((json) => {\n    console.log('JSON from Shakeitspeare.com', json)\n  }).catch((ex) => {\n    console.log('An error occured while parsing!', ex)\n  });\n\nLet's break this API call down into a few steps.\n\nFirst, we define our API URL to fetch from and fetch() from that API URL.\nThen we take the response when the server provides it. We return the response.json()\nThen we take that json and console.log it.\nIf an error occurs, we catch it and log it.\n\nThat's as simple as fetch is. While there are other ways to handle the response (such as html or blob), this approach makes writing requests to APIs and other network calls in Javascript easy.\n\nProduction Warning! It is important to note that while this is an ES6 standard, some browsers such as Internet Explorer do not support; yet Edge does. You may need a polyfill for live projects. If you need a polyfill for a production project, Github's polyfill is very popular.\n\nQuiz!\nIt is time for you to build a very simple component that posts a movie title and poster after searching for it. We'll do this using the OMDB API. For practice, create a new react application. Before doing so, challenge yourself to a mini quiz.\n\n\n  Q: Which React.Component method should API calls be made from?\n\n  > `componentDidMount()`. Per the [React documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#componentdidmount), _If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request._\n\n\n\n\n\n  Q: What does it mean to make `GET` request?\n\n  > We are asking the server to send us data to read. To `GET` means to \"read.\"\n\n\n\n\nFetching from OMDB in a React Component\nNow, let's use the fetch() API directly inside of a React Component to render movies. We will create a re-usable component that can individually fetch and render information about a movie from OMDB. The official React documentation tells developers that any network requests should be placed inside of the componentDidMount method. Let's start building a component with this method defined.\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\n\nclass Movie extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n      /* nothing here... yet! */\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n        \n          \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nWe can now tell our component to fetch a movie and then set it to our state. We can then render an indivual movie. We do this by adding the fetch() call inside of componentDidMount(). Calling setState then triggers a re-render inside of our component.\nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\n\nclass Movie extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n      // fetch a movie\n      fetch('http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Tron')\n          // then parse response to json\n      .then(function(response) {\n        return response.json()\n      // then use that json\n      }).then(function(json) {\n        console.log('Parsed JSON', json);\n        base.setState({ movie: json });\n      // catch an error if one occurs\n      }).catch(function(ex) {\n        console.log('Parsing JSON failed', ex)\n        alert('Error! ' + ex);\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n       let title = this.state.movie.Title;\n    return (\n        \n            I really like {title}!\n          \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nFinally, let's get a movie - any movie - and render it. \nimport React, {Component} from 'react';\n\nclass Movie extends Component {\n\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n  }\n\n  componentDidMount() {\n    fetch('http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=' + this.props.movieSearchQuery)\n      .then(function(response) {\n        return response.json()\n      }).then(function(json) {\n        console.log('Parsed JSON', json)\n        base.setState({ movie: json });\n      }).catch(function(ex) {\n        console.log('Parsing JSON failed', ex)\n        alert('Error! ' + ex);\n      });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n       let title = this.state.movie.Title;\n       let director = this.state.movie.Director;\n    return (\n        \n            I really like {title} by {director}!\n          \n    );\n  }\n}\n\nOur component can now be re-used for any movie using the following syntax.\n\n\nWhen the props.movieSearchQuery of The Empire Strikes Back is provided to our component, fetch() will then use it as part of the search query.\nYour turn: Build a Weather App\nUse the OpenWeather API to fetch the weather from a certain zip code, and update the page to reflect the current weather. Documentation\nRequirements\n\nAsk the user to input the zip they would like to see the weather for. (Hint: use Prompt)\n\nUse fetch() to send a request the OpenWeather API.\nNOTE: Because the OpenWeather API is not an open API, every request must end with '&appid=052f26926ae9784c2d677ca7bc5dec98' (i.e. http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=60614,us&appid=052f26926ae9784c2d677ca7bc5dec98)\n\nUse the response to display the current temperature in fahrenheit, the high and low temperate in fahrenheit, the current weather \"description\", and the name of the city that came back from the API\n\nSpend a little time styling the app. Here's some inspiration (Don't worry about the lens flare!) \n\n\n\nRead about the fetch API on MDN for further reading.\n"}}}
